<p>Education in Gaul during the fourth and fifth centuries after
Christ has curiously escaped the makers of books. Yet it has
more than one claim to notice. It was an age, like our own, of
transition, and we see education passing through the last stage
of official paganism in the Western Empire, and entering into
the Christian era. Movements and counter-movements (which
have a considerable measure of modern interest) pass before our
eyes. For behind the shifting scenes of Roman and Barbarian,
Pagan and Christian, there is a continuity which reaches to the
present day. That continuity is the immense fabric of Roman
Education which passed through the Church into the Middle
Ages, and shaped the thought and culture of modern nations.</p>

<p>Gaul raises the problem of complex nationality. The old
Celtic population, overlaid with Roman civilization, penetrated
by Germanic tribes—Goths, Franks, Burgundians—is about to
enter on a new period of history, and the blending of these
elements has an influence on education which is interesting.
Nations, when they become great, are prone to emphasize the
purity of their race and language. They exclude foreign words
and customs whenever they can, they raise the boast of a pure
and unique culture. It is an empty boast. Thousands of
‘foreign’ elements have mingled to make them what they are,
and unconsciously they daily absorb fresh elements that are
‘foreign’. But so far do they forget this, that sometimes pride,
and the ignorance that is born of exclusiveness, lead them to
impose their culture on others by force. Complex nationality,
while it is in the making, means friction; but once that stage
is passed the result is almost always a richer and better culture.
So it was with Gaul. Her position as leader of the Roman
Empire in education was undoubtedly due largely to her
complexity.</p>

<p>At the same time, there is the problem of recognition. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
elements of the complex whole cannot be kept from discord
unless there is recognition of their individuality. Not till then
will they make their positive contribution to enrich the State.
How far the Romans recognized the individuality of those whom
they governed, and with what results, is a question of interest
for modern political thought. And the effect of such recognition
(or the lack thereof) on the school curriculum, for example, in
the teaching of history, is a pertinent problem for those who live
in countries where there is a dual nationality.</p>

<p>It has been borne in upon us that the teaching of history is
all-important. Everybody is seeking to find the ultimate causes
of the war, and one of the most far-reaching answers that can
be given is that history has been wrongly taught. The fireworks
of history have been displayed to us, but the permanent
forces behind events, the thought and psychology of nations,
the human interest of character, in fine, all that truly makes
for understanding and progress has been neglected. It was
neglected in the Roman Empire, and it is instructive to note the
results.</p>

<p>To a South African the situation in Gaul at this time is
particularly illuminating. After all the troubles (still fresh in
our memory) attaching to the solution of the language question,
it is almost startling to note a similar situation in Roman Gaul.
There the question of teaching Greek and Latin was not so acute
as in South Africa, for Greek was dying out, and had no racial
background, but the effects of a wrong handling of ‘the second
language’ are as unmistakable and instructive. It is not time
or place or circumstance that matters in educational method so
much as psychology—a study that is only beginning to come
into its heritage—and the psychology of the child is the same
yesterday as to-day.</p>

<p>To us the language question in Gaul is interesting from another
point of view too. The Romans did the world a great service by
keeping their language uniform. This they did chiefly by means
of their law, which was understood throughout the Roman world,
and by means of their professors, who, like the Panegyrists in
Gaul during the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, handed down a language
which remained for centuries very similar to that of Cicero.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
But a time came when this attempt failed. When Christian
teaching became strong and widespread, it was found that to
the bulk of the people the polished rhetoric of the schools had
become strange. In order to touch the understanding of their
flock, the bishops were constrained (with sore travail, for at heart
they were proud of their pagan education) to discard the style of
speech in which they had been trained, and to come closer to
the idiom of the masses. So in South Africa it has been officially
recognized that the language of Holland has become strange to
the school-child, and that in order to reach his intelligence we
must use the offspring of Holland Dutch, Afrikaans—moulded,
since 1652, to a vastly different climate, scenery, and national
character. How this attempt is to be made, and what its danger
is in the direction of formlessness—these are questions for which
something may be gleaned from a consideration of the Latin of
the Fathers. Art is needed and scientific interest. For lack of
these the vivid language of Tertullian and the early Fathers
degenerated later into formlessness. And our problem to-day is
to watch over the form that is taking shape, make clear its
scientific basis, and beautify it by spreading an interest in Art.</p>

<p>Finally, the Gauls witnessed the breaking up of governments
and its consequent disorders. They were faced, as we are, by
the problem of ‘Bolshevism’, though in their case it merely
took the shape of the marauding Vargi and the Bagaudae. The
influence of a disordered society on education was felt then as
now. With us there are some who, like Avitus of Vienne, <i>in
malis ferventibus</i>, despair of any end to the troubles which
throng around them, while the wiser sort will rather urge with
the author of the <i>De Providentia Dei</i> that, despite disappointments,</p>

<p>This study has been based, as far as possible, directly on
original authorities, who have been neglected largely because
they fall in a period which the pedant has called ‘unclassical’
and which is yet not definitely ‘modern’. I have found many
statements in modern books relating to this period which need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
modification or correcting, and I feel sure that this essay has
merely touched a field that deserves more attention than it has
hitherto received.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Among those to whom my gratitude is due, I wish to mention
particularly my tutor, Professor E. W. Watson of Christ Church,
Professor J. A. Smith of Magdalen, Professor Percy Gardner,
who read the archaeological part, Professor Gilbert Murray,
whose suggestions were helpful and inspiring, and the examiners
of this essay when it was put forward as a thesis at Oxford.
Professor Haverfield and Mr. R. L. Poole, through whose influence
it was accepted for publication. Since then the material has
been considerably revised and amplified. For help in the dreary
work of reading the proofs, I must record my thanks to my old
and trusted guide, Professor William Ritchie, of the University
of Cape Town, and to my wife. And there is one whose memory
I must always cherish, in this as in other spheres, with the
deepest affection and gratitude—my former tutor, the late
Mr. H. J. Cunningham of Worcester. His encouragement and
counsel were invaluable, and his readiness to assist one of the
pleasantest memories of my work.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge the courtesy of the Rhodes Trustees
in allowing me to use part of my scholarship to defray the
expenses of publication; and I must not fail also to put on record
the financial assistance given me by the Government Research
Grant Board of the Union of South Africa. Such assistance is
not inappropriate for a book that deals so largely with State
support of education, and it is the more pleasing in view of the
growing interest of the Government in research.</p>

<p>Finally, I must mention the uniform courtesy and attention
that I have received from the Clarendon Press authorities.
To Mr. C. E. Freeman I owe a particular debt of gratitude for
many interesting suggestions.</p>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Limits of the Period</span></h3>

<p>In considering the extent of the last phase of Gallo-Roman
education one is met by the obvious difficulty of limits. For
the main traditions of the Roman schools were formed before
Julius Caesar, and go on through the Middle Ages up to the
present day.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find a starting-point. The fifth century, the
transition period between ‘ancient’ and ‘modern’ history,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> forms
a general terminus, but it is not so easy to find a particular one.
To say that the year 476 was the end of things Roman in Gaul
is to be guilty of a generalization which many scholars have
attacked.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This year, ‘so dear to the compiler and the crammer’,
is not of any special moment for Gaul. If we must fix a
boundary, it seems better to connect it with the Franks. It is
often nationality which produces great changes in civilization.
It was the coming of the Romans which shaped the education
of Gaul, and it was the coming of the Franks which most
modified that shape and gave rise to the French nation. The
defeat of the Franks by Julian in 358 meant the continuation of
Roman culture in Gaul. He came as the saviour of a despairing
Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Salian Franks were allowed to settle in Toxandria
in the North as members of the Empire, to which, for a long
time, they remained loyal. It is true that Arbogast the Frank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
set up the usurper Eugenius in 392. On the other hand, one of
Gratian’s wisest and most faithful adherents was the Frankish
Merobaudes,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and when the great invasions of 406 and the
following years began the Franks allied themselves with
Stilicho and defeated the Vandals. Even as late as 451 we find
that only a part of the Franks join Attila in his invasion of
Gaul, in spite of the growing weakness of the Empire which had
left Gaul exposed to the barbarians in 406.</p>

<p>Such was the effect of Julian’s victory, though as a military
achievement it was not very remarkable. Not merely was it
of political importance, but its significance for education was
enormous. Mamertinus expresses<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the gratitude of a provincial
for the order which Julian restored. ‘Shall I’, says he, ‘tell the
tale of the Gallic provinces, now rewon by thy valour, of the
rout of barbarism, as though it were some new and unheard of
thing? Such exploits as the voice of fame has so lavishly
bruited abroad....’</p>

<p>Julian has been constant in his care for Gaul, and on the list
of his good deeds the orator would record his diligence:</p>

<p>‘Ita illi anni spatia divisa sunt ut aut barbaros domitet aut
civibus iura restituat, perpetuum professus aut contra hostem
aut contra vitia certamen.’ A great cause of joy is the repulse
of <i>barbaria</i>. Julian has spared no trouble ‘to restore peace to
the loyal provinces and to banish, at the same time, all barbaric
elements’.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He attended to right living and to justice, ‘emendatio
morum iudiciorumque correctio....’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Most important of
all, studies have revived under his fostering care, and the orator
becomes eloquent with an enthusiasm which is not entirely
exaggerated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>‘Thou, O mightiest of emperors, thou, I proclaim, hast rekindled
the dead fires of literature; thou hast not only freed
philosophy from prosecution, suspected as she was until recently,
but hast clothed her in purple and bound on her head gold and
gems, and seated her on a regal throne.’<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>If the subjugation of the Franks thus supplies a sort of
starting-point, their rise under Chlodowig gives us a terminus.
The Roman connexion with Gaul officially ceased when Romulus
Augustulus was deposed in 476, and Gaul was no longer Roman
when Euric captured Arles and Marseilles in 480. But the
culmination of Germanic influence in Gaul was the coming of
the Franks in 486, when Chlodowig drove Syagrius, ‘the last
of the Romans’,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> from his kingdom of Soissons and moved
southward. The Roman schools, which had flourished under
Theodoric of Toulouse, disappeared when the Franks came.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Not that the Franks swamped the Gallo-Romans or proved the
predominant element. Their invasion was in some ways like
the Norman invasion of England:<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the conqueror was captured
by the conquered, and Gallo-Roman influence, especially in
education, prevailed. Yet the fact remains that the Frankish
invasion brought factors to bear on Gaul which modified its
national life and coloured its civilization more deeply than had
previously been the case, and that it represents the high-water
mark of the Germanic tide which had been steadily rising during
the two previous centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Greek Influence</span></h3>

<p>Nothing struck the imagination of ancient writers on early
Gallic culture more than the part played by Massilia. Daughter
of the Greeks, and friend of the Romans long before Gaul
became part of the Empire, she stood forth as a light of civilization
in the midst of barbaric darkness. With such a tradition
and such a friendship it is no wonder that we find so much said
in her praise.</p>

<p>Ammianus,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> following the Greek Timagenes, gives the traditional
account of the coming of the Phocaeans to Massilia in the
sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Whether they really fled from the persecution
of the Persian Harpalus—a motive unknown to Herodotus—or
whether, as Athenaeus quoting Aristotle says, their object was
merely trade,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> need not be discussed here. Nor need we go into
the confusion in ancient writers between Phocaea and Phocis<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
in regard to the origin of Massilia; the point is that it was of
Greek origin, as all the authorities agree.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> From Greece culture
came to Gaul, and once more (as Norden remarks in another
connexion) ‘it is the East that gives and the West that
receives’.</p>

<p>The coins of Massilia bear testimony to her influence on Gaul.
The early specimens of her drachms, bearing the head of Artemis
with sprigs of olive in her hair, show a high artistic development.
Their beauty diminishes as time goes on, partly because of the
large numbers in which they were produced, since for a long
time they were the chief currency for Southern Gaul as far as
Lyons and for the whole valley of the Po. So frequently were
they copied by the Celtic tribes that the imitations are far
commoner than the originals.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It is probable, moreover, that Massilia’s artistic contribution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
did not stop here. We possess a torso in sixth-century style of
Aphrodite with a dove on her right hand, which Prof. Percy
Gardner believes to be the work of Phocaean Greeks at Massilia.
Sculpture of this kind must have been a new ray of light for the
civilization (or the lack thereof) in Celtic Gaul.</p>

<p>Her friendship with Rome is well attested. Cicero mentions<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
the support given to Rome by the Massilians at the
time of the Gallic campaigns. When Fonteius, who had been
governor of Gallia Narbonensis, was impeached for extortion,
Massilia came up in his defence. Strabo regards the connexion
as a well-known fact.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Ammianus, too, knew of this traditional
friendship: ‘Massilia ... cuius societate et viribus in discriminibus
arduis fultam aliquotiens legimus Romam.’<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>It is well known that at the time of the second Punic war
Massilia gave faithful and effective support to her ally.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Yet
such was the independence of Massilia’s Greek spirit, that when
Caesar, in the Civil war,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> sent Domitius to take her, she alone
of all the Gallic cities refused him admittance. Her citizens
replied with a dignity and a self-consciousness that argue a high
level of development, that they were indeed allies of the Roman
people, but that they would not and could not decide between the
two parties: if they were approached in a friendly spirit they
would listen to both sides; if in a hostile way they would listen
to neither. Caesar’s siege of the town was at first unsuccessful,
and he had to depart leaving the operations in the hands of
others. When, at length, Massilia capitulated, he deprived her
of her material resources, but (as was fitting) left her liberty
unviolated.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>But the connexion with Rome was not political only. It is
probable that the Massilians traded with Italy in early times<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and that their city, once the rival of Carthage,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> grew to renewed
importance as a commercial centre for Rome after the Punic
wars. The Massilians were early Rome’s agents for the products
of Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In order to make bronze to send to Rome they
obtained tin from Cornwall<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> to blend with their own copper.
Theophrastus<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> speaks of their export to Rome of precious stones,
and the Romans knew the value of their corn trade.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> ‘Frumenti
praecipue ac pabuli ferax (Gallia).’<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Yet the chief connexion with Rome, the bond most frequently
mentioned by Roman writers, was along the line of Massilia’s
culture. Cicero speaks with enthusiasm<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> of the city which
possessed a statue of Minerva, and it is well known that the
Romans regularly sent their sons there,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> rather than to Athens,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
to study Greek. The young Agricola looked on it as his Alma
Mater.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The climate was milder and healthier than that of
Athens and its morals had a better reputation. Plautus uses
the phrase ‘mores Massilienses’ in the sense of irreproachable
character.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Valerius Maximus speaks of the city as ‘severitatis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
custos acerrima’. They prohibited pantomimes on moral grounds;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
sumptuary laws limited personal expense; and women were not
allowed to drink wine.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Such was the moral austerity (at any
rate in early times<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>) of the Massilians, and this reputation no
doubt enhanced its popularity—with parents at any rate—as an
educational centre.</p>

<p>Massilia stood for a very long time far above any other Gallic
city in culture. The Rhodians in Livy<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> are made to say that
the Massilians would long ago have been barbarized by the
uncivilized tribes around (<i>tot indomitae circumfusae gentes</i>) had it
not been for their sheltered situation; and Pomponius Mela<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
speaks of Massilia as ‘olim inter asperas posita’, and remarks
that the Massilians nevertheless retained their individuality
after the civilization of the rest. They had their own constitution,
and it was prominent enough for Aristotle to notice.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Many writers tell us how the Massilians spread their Greek
civilization among the Gauls.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Strabo speaks of Massilia as the
School of Gaul, which so hellenized the barbarians that they
drew up their contracts in Greek.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> So Ammianus<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> says that after
the foundation of Massilia ‘men gradually became civilized in
these parts, and the pursuit of praiseworthy branches of knowledge,
begun by the bards and the Celtic philosophers (<i>euhages</i> and
<i>drasidae</i>), grew and prospered’. The bards sang in heroic verse, to
the accompaniment of tuneful music, the deeds of the valiant.
The <i>euhages</i> were natural philosophers who investigated the
secrets of the physical world, ‘scrutantes seriem et sublimia
naturae pandere conabantur’. And, according to Pythagoras,
the <i>drasidae</i>, who were of loftier spirit and lived in exclusive
clubs and colleges, investigated and pronounced on occult metaphysical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
questions. So effectively did Greek influence spread,
‘ut non Graecia in Galliam emigrasse, sed Gallia in Graeciam
translata videretur’.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>To a certain extent Massilia must have been influenced by
her surroundings. ‘Massilia’, says the consul in Livy,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> ‘inter
Gallos sita traxit aliquantum ab accolis animorum’. Her inhabitants
must have learned much of the physical features and culture
of the land from the barbarians. But the overwhelming strength
of influence was on their side. The fact that they were not
swamped is in itself a striking testimony. It meant that they
possessed a culture which was destined not only to hold its own,
but to win increasingly as time went on. It was owing to
them that the Gauls appointed professors and doctors,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and
many of their teachers are mentioned in ancient literature.
Telon and Gyareus are called by Lucan<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> ‘gemini fratres,
fecundae gloria matris’, and together with Lydanus, Pytheas,
Eratosthenes, Eudimenes, are famous for mathematics and
astronomy<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in the early days of Massilia. Seneca mentions
a rhetorician Moschus, who had been found guilty of poisoning
and taught at Massilia,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and notices also Agroitas as a rhetorician
of distinction.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Natural philosophy was not neglected. Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
mentions Euthymenes of Massilia, whose opinion he quotes on
the overflowing of the Nile, and refers to the famous Pytheas
on the causes of the tides. Of the eight recensions of Homer,
which were known before Zenodotus, one was the famous
διόρθωσις Μασσαλιωτική<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to which Wolf assigns an honourable
place.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>As for their proficiency in languages, it is well known that
they were called <i>trilingues</i>,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> speaking Greek and Latin and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Celtic. The Greek of Massilia left its mark on the French
language after a lapse of many centuries, especially on the
proper names of Aquitaine,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and Christian times afford many
instances in literature and inscriptions of this influence. To
name two only, the Acta Martyrum were written in Greek, the
language of Irenaeus (second century), by the order of the
Churches of Vienne and Lyons,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and as late as the sixth century
Caesarius<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> could make the people of his congregation at Arles
sing in Greek. As late as the Middle Ages the territory around
Massilia was called Graecia, and its sea Mare Graecum.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Such was the great part played by Massilia. Tradition tells
how the leaders of the Phocaeans, Protis and Simos, when they
landed in Gaul, went to the local King Nannus for help. They
were invited to attend a ceremony at which the daughter of the
king extended a cup of water to the suitor whom she favoured.
She bestowed the token on Protis, who thus married a daughter
of the soil on which he was to establish Massilia.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> So Massilia
ruled the household of Gaul and set in order its culture. In
imperial times there was a decline,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and the Massilians found
their pre-eminence shaken and their trade ruined by the colony
which Caesar sent to Arles (destined to develop into a commercial
centre) under Tiberius, father of the Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Under
Marcus Aurelius they had to give up their ancient constitution
and fall into line with the other imperial cities.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> But their
work was accomplished. They kept the torch of civilization
burning until they could pass it on to Romanized Gaul. Even
then they retained their culture, and retained it longer than the
other towns. The capture of Massilia in 477 by the Goths<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
completed the separation of Gaul from Rome and prepared the
way for the Gallo-Frankish state.</p>

<p>As she had given the impetus to letters, so, in later times,
she proved their salvation. At the time of the great invasions
at the beginning of the fifth century, and at its end when the
Visigoths were encroaching more and more, Massilia was a
refuge for Christian monks to whose labours literature owes so
much. The Monastery of St. Victor ranked with Lérins as
a centre of Christian education, and many famous men found
a refuge there during the menace of troublous times. Victorinus,
Prosper of Aquitaine, Gennadius, Musaeus, Salvian, were among
those who sought its peace.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Justinus tells of the Celtic chief Catumandus who was chosen
by the neighbouring tribes to lead an army against the prosperous
Massilia. Being terrified, however, by the figure of a fierce-looking
woman whom he saw in a dream, he made peace with
the Massilians and begged to be allowed to enter their city and
worship their gods. In the portico of the temple he saw the
statue of Minerva and exclaimed that that was the figure of his
dream.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was that the goddess of culture saved Massilia, and
through Massilia, Gaul.</p>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Celtic Influence</span></h3>

<p>Bouquet<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> refers to a legendary account given by one Pezronius
to explain the rise of culture among the Gauls. On the death
of Pluto, Jupiter gave to Mercury the Empire of the West and
he, by his wit and eloquence, civilized the people. ‘Populorum
sibi subditorum ferocitatem emollivit, leges statuit, artes adinvenit,
commercia inter Occidentales populos instituit’. For this
service the Celts of Gaul were so thankful that for two thousand
years they worshipped Mercury with the greatest veneration.</p>

<p>This story is a fable and an afterthought, but it is significant
of the sort of culture that later people conceived of as having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
existed among the ancient Gauls. Long before the days of
Roman rule the elder Cato had testified to the trend of their
genius in the well-known words: ‘Pleraque Gallia duas res
industriosissima persequitur, rem militarem et argute loqui’,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
and it is quite certain that Mercury (and before the Romans his
Celtic counterpart) was actually and almost universally worshipped
in Gaul. ‘Galli’, says Caesar,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> ‘Deum maxime Mercurium
colunt’, a statement which is abundantly supported by
the inscriptions. An inscription at Chalon-sur-Saône shows the
figure of Mercury with his three favourite animals, a cock,
a tortoise, a goat, and the words ‘Deo Mercurio Augu ...
Sacro’,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> while at Lyons there were three altars with the words
‘Mercurio Augusto et Maiae Augustae’. An inscription of
Poitiers, which is as late as the third century, is dedicated to
‘the god Mercurius’.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Even in the barbarous North there is
a large number of inscriptions referring to Mercury, especially
around Trèves.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The worship of Minerva, too, is established by
many inscriptions, e.g. the twenty on bowls and cups found at
Andecavi in Lugdunensis.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Thus the Gauls singled out for special worship the subtlest
and cleverest of the gods,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and the fact may be connected with
their undoubted culture in early times. Out of the darkness in
which pre-Roman Gaul is shrouded we gather hints here and
there concerning the first known teachers of the Gallic Celts,
the Druids. One or two points may be noticed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>The warlike nature of the Celts is a subject of frequent
comment. Aristotle refers to it,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and Aelian says Ἀνθρώπων
ἐγὼ ἀκούω φιλοκινδυνοτάτους εἶναι τοὺς Κέλτους.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Pausanias
considered them very barbarous. Their equipment for war, in
which they were supposed to excel, was primitive: they had no
defensive armour except shields. Of scientific warfare they
knew nothing, and when they charged it was without order, like
a troop of wild animals.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> In these accounts a margin must be
left for prejudice and lack of understanding on the part of the
narrator. For we hear a good deal about education from various
sources. Three classes of skilled men were held in particular
honour among the Celts:<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> the βάρδοι, who chanted hymns in
honour of the valiant; τῶν μὲν ᾀσμάτων ὑποθέσεις ποιοῦνται
τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοὺς ἀποθανόντας ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ καλῶς:<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> the
Οὐάτεις (Vates), who performed sacrifice and studied natural
science; and the Δρυΐδαι, who studied science and ethics and
theology. The bards also were the representatives of that
eloquent temperament which is associated with Gaul from the
earliest times, and which enabled subsequent Gallic writers and
orators to assimilate classical rhetoric. They sing public panegyrics
(μετ’ ᾠδῆς ἐπαίνους λέγοντες) and are taken with the
army to eulogize the heroes of war.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> They are called ποιηταὶ
μελῶν by Diodorus,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> who is constrained to remark οὕτω καὶπαρὰ
τοῖς ἀγριωτάτοις βαρβάροις ὁ θυμὸς εἴκει τῇ σοφίᾳ καὶ ὁ Ἄρης
αἰδεῖται τὰς Μούσας, a somewhat unusual admission, for a
Greek, of culture among ‘barbarians’. It must be clearly
understood, however, that they had not elaborated a system of
rhetoric or studied scientifically the art of speaking. All we
can say is that they had a kind of imagination and a quick
enthusiasm which gave them a rough natural oratory, and made
them apt students of the rhetoric which the Greeks and Romans
brought. The richness and pomposity of subsequent Gallic
orators was due rather to the advent of the rhetorical system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
and, perhaps, to the influence of Roman character, than to
native Celtic qualities. Caesar does not mention the Bardi and
the Vates, but only the Druids, who belonged to the upper
classes, and were held in high honour as the teachers and priests
of the nation. ‘They administer divine rites, attend to public
and private sacrifice, and expound theology: to them a large
number of youths resort for training, and great is the honour in
which they are held.’<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> It is said that there were girls’ schools
kept by the wives of the Druids,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> a statement which seems to
be supported by the frequent mention of female Druids, Drysidae,
in later times. Their learning was thought to be derived from
Britain, whither students went from Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Freedom from
military service and public duties was granted them—a curious
anticipation of the concessions granted to teachers in imperial
times. Hence there were many candidates for the office, and
large numbers were sent by their parents to undergo the training
which sometimes lasted twenty years.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The students learnt by
heart a great many verses, which were not written down, for
this they did not consider right (<i>fas</i>), though for secular purposes
they used Greek letters. Examples of this writing have been
preserved.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The Druids taught the doctrine of immortality and
the transmigration of souls.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Astronomy, physical science, and
theology also formed part of their training.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Science was still
studied by the Druids in Cicero’s time. ‘In Gaul too’ (he says),
‘there are Druids (and I had personal acquaintance with one of
them, the Aeduan Divitiacus) who professed a knowledge of
natural science, which the Greeks call φυσιολογία.’<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>This education, however, was purely one of class and profession.
‘Docent multa nobilissimos gentis’, says Mela.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Lucan
apostrophizes the Druids, as those who alone had the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of knowing or not knowing the gods, dwelling in the sequestered
glades of deep forests.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Knowledge, thus monopolized, must have grown unhealthy,
and we hear of the riddling speech and obscure phrases with
which the Druids worked on the superstitions of the people.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Monnard observes that the darkness of this Celtic philosophy
was dispelled by the light of Massilia.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Yet the Celts had made their contribution. For we must
remember that in the centuries just preceding the Christian era it
was the Celts who gave the lead to the Teutonic peoples in culture.
Towards the end of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Celtic civilization flourished
exceedingly. The ‘La Tène Civilization’—as the archaeologists
call it—shows artistic products of fine taste and technical
perfection. The centre of this civilization was perhaps in Southern
France, whence it spread throughout Europe along the Rhine, the
Rhone, the Danube, until it was succeeded by Graeco-Roman
culture. And it was only between 100-70 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> that the Celts were
expelled from lower Germany.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>It is hardly surprising, therefore, that it took so long for the
Druids to disappear from the scene, representing as they did so
ancient a culture. We should expect the warders of a national
religion and tradition to be conservative, and we find that they
even played a political part. In the confusion of the year
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70, when the Capitol was burnt down, they circulated
a rumour among the Celts that the event portended the passing
of the power from the Romans to the Gauls,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> seeing that the
Capitol had once proved to be the only obstacle to Brennus’s
victorious march. It was natural, then, that the Roman imperial
policy should aim at the removal of an element which fostered
the national sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Augustus later followed this tendency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
when he forbade the Druid’s worship to Roman citizens in
Gaul, and Claudius (we are told by Suetonius) abolished once
for all their monstrous practices.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> So Aurelius Victor<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> attributes
the complete suppression of the Druids to Claudius. Accordingly,
when we find Pliny<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> saying that it was Tiberius who
suppressed the Druids, there is a suspicion that he is guilty of
a confusion: Claudius’s first name having been Tiberius.</p>

<p>It is clear that definite attempts were made to wipe out
Druidism and the Celtic element. But they showed a remarkable
tenacity in spite of laws and edicts. The elder Pliny refers
to them as surviving in his time,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and Flavius Vopiscus (third
century) tells of certain ‘wise women’ who called themselves
Dryades (<i>mulier dryas</i>, <i>drysada</i>) and were, by a strange irony, consulted
(if we may believe the fanciful <i>Scriptores Historiae Augustae</i>),
even by persons in high imperial authority. Aurelianus was said
to have consulted them about the future of his imperial office,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
and a Druid prophesied the throne to Diocletian ‘cum aprum
occideris’.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The prophetic influence seems in these later times to
have passed from the men to the women, who become recognized
semi-officially, and form, on a small scale, a sort of Delphic oracle.</p>

<p>Nothing is more difficult than to make a people forget its
language, as Fauriel<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> has remarked, especially a people that
largely lives on the land. This dictum, which history has so
often illustrated, is instanced also by the tenacity of Celtic in
Gaul. It penetrates right into the fourth and fifth centuries,
and, since language and education hang so closely together, it is
worth while to look into the evidence. More than 10,000
inscriptions have been found in Gaul, and of these a large
number relate to the lower classes. Yet we find that scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
twenty are in Celtic, and these probably are not later than the
first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> This does not mean that Celtic died out
then; it was never much of a written language, for the Druids
had a distinct prejudice against writing, and recorded only
secular matters.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Strabo<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> says that the people in Narbonne began to accept
Latin only in the reign of Tiberius, and it is in Narbonne that
the most and best Latin inscriptions are found. Irenaeus,
writing from Lyons in the second century, begs to be excused
from rhetorical polish, seeing that he lives among the Celts—περὶ
βάρβαρον διάλεκτον τὸ πλεῖστον ἀσχολουμενων (ἡμῶν).<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
In the following century we find Alexander Severus, in preparing
his last expedition, being met by a female Druid who prophesied
his death in Celtic (<i>Gallico sermone</i>)<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>—though the reference may
have been inserted merely to adorn a tale, and <i>Gallicus sermo</i>
may stand for Gallic Latin. At any rate, Celtic was not entirely
forgotten in Ausonius’s day (fourth century), who refers to
Patera, rhetor at Bordeaux, as ‘stirpe Druidarum satus’, while
Phoebicius similarly is ‘stirpe satus Druidum’,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and is, moreover,
the ‘temple-warder of Belenus’,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> the Celtic Apollo, just as the
race of Patera comes ‘Beleni ... e templo’. In satirizing the
pedantic trifling of the grammarian, Ausonius gives ‘al’ and
‘tau’ as Celtic letters.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Even Sidonius in the fifth century has
to notice it, in spite of his Roman disdain. It was owing to the
zeal of Ecdicius, he says,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> that the nobility of Gaul became
cultured—‘sermonis Celtici squamam depositura’, a statement
which shows that the old language was still to be reckoned with.
It is rather an irony of fate that the style of Sidonius—the one
point on which he prided himself—undoubtedly owes its exotic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
character in order, rhythm, and vocabulary<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> to Celtic and Gothic
influence. His elaborate scorn for what is foreign recoils on his
own head.</p>

<p>One final instance of the survival of Celtic must be mentioned
for the controversy which it has evoked. Jerome says that the
Galatians in his day had practically the same native language as
the Treveri.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Was this language Celtic? Freeman<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> thinks that
Jerome’s word may be doubted, as he was not a philologist.
This would seem to rule out all the witnesses, for philology is an
entirely modern development; and it would hardly have been
indispensable for forming so simple a judgement. Jerome,
moreover, is a considerable authority, the most learned of the
Fathers. Lavisse<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> has recently accepted his statement. He
mentions the objection of Perrot,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> who maintains that Celtic
had long vanished from Asia Minor, and of Fustel de Coulanges,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
who says that the language of the Treveri was German, and
answers: (1) that Celtic survived in the speech if not in the
documents of Asia Minor, and (2) that Coulanges is wrong; the
names of the Treveri are Celtic. This being granted, it would
seem that Celtic survived well into the fifth century, and this
conclusion appears to be reinforced in extent and significance by
Freeman’s statement that there was a survival of the Celtic
language and sentiment in Brittany during the fifth century.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
But this statement is misleading. It is generally admitted that
Gallic had entirely gone out of use in Armorica, when the
fugitives from Great Britain settled in the country and introduced
their insular speech from the fifth century onwards. And
Breton is more closely allied to Welsh and Old Cornish than to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Gallic. On the whole we must say that the evidence of modern
philology points to a less considerable influence of the Celtic
element than we should expect. Celtic was overshadowed by
German, and especially, of course, Latin. Hitherto modern
philology has found traces of Celtic loan-words in the following
spheres: agriculture, carriage-building, the names of animals,
trees, and plants, the parts of the body, items of clothing,
weapons, and geographical terms.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The inscriptions in Gaul
show words like <i>cantalon</i>,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> a kind of building, and <i>cantuna</i>
(canteen) which the philologists pronounce to be of Celtic origin.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
We must conclude, therefore, that while sporadic traces of Celtic
are undoubtedly found in the fifth century (as in the case of the
Treviri, who in their secluded valley would naturally retain
the ancient language longer than the people around them),
the language had, in the main, disappeared by that time.</p>

<p>All this shows us that in dealing with education in Gaul we
cannot attempt a thorough and systematic study. Romanization
lies over the country and its institutions like a veil. Roman
authors give us scattered pictures of what went on beneath
that veil, but they give it from the Roman point of view.
Roman rule was so mighty, and its methods so far-reaching,
that everything is reduced to Roman form. The ruler did not
see the native genius or native ways, or if he saw them did
not understand or sympathize. It was his task to rule, and he
knew, in general, only one method: the rule of force—‘parcere
subiectis et debellare superbos’—though diplomacy plays a large
part in the later Empire. Moreover, the mass of the people
were too uneducated to give expression to their individuality, or
did not know Latin sufficiently well to do so. All our evidence
comes from Greek or Roman pens. As soon as the Empire is
withdrawn from Gaul natural differences find expression and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
variety of individuality is at once displayed. Jung<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> notices that
the inscriptions of Arles and Trèves are an illustration of this.
While the Empire is there we catch only dim glimpses of the
sort of education that (fraught with the traditions of a mighty
past) may have lingered on among the mass of the people even
as late as the fourth century. When we deal with the schools of
Gaul, therefore, it must be with those of the Gallo-Romans who
were more Roman than Gallic. But there is another element
which operated, as it were, under the surface of Romanization
in Gaul.</p>

<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Germanic Influence</span></h3>

<p>In trying to form an idea, of the influence of the Germanic
races on the culture of Gaul during the later Empire, we must
again be satisfied with only a few stray references in the contemporary
authorities. Philologists think that as early as the
first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> the German races must have influenced the
Romans. They establish indisputable cases, but it is admitted
that the whole question is difficult and complicated in the
extreme.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The question of German influence may be looked at from two
opposite points of view—from the constructive and the destructive.
The latter is by far the more prominent and will be dealt
with at a later stage. The former is far the more difficult, and
nothing is attempted here except to set down in bare outline one
or two of its aspects. It would be far easier to describe the
influence of Roman civilization on the barbarians.</p>

<p>Yet there is something to be said. If the Roman generals
prescribed a Roman form of government for the barbarians, as
Corbulo did for the Frisians in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 47, German fashions intruded
into the Roman world and the Roman ladies wore barbarian
costume and coiffure.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> On the Rhine frontier these barbarians
developed to such an extent and so many towns sprang up—Cologne
the prosperous, Bonn, Coblentz, Strassburg—which grew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
out of the Roman camps but drew their life from the neighbouring
tribes, that the law forbade the selling of certain commodities
to barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> On the other hand, the Empire needed them as
cultivators and soldiers, and the <i>Panegyrici Latini</i> show us that
it was part of the imperial policy to make them settle in the
provinces.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Social history shows that the Germanic peoples
stood on a fairly high level of culture even in the first centuries
of our era. They possessed a traditional religious cult which
promoted the noblest virtues—conjugal love, friendship, hospitality—a
body of legends about gods and heroes, an ancestral
poetry, in which clan and family feeling plays a large part.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In
these respects they were capable of influencing the Romans, who
admired their courage and feared their strength.</p>

<p>Besides the casual intermingling of people for various reasons,
there were three main sources of intercourse: the army, the
administration, and trade. The first need not be dwelt on, nor
the well-known question be raised how far the German element
in it was responsible for the fall of the Empire. Of the second
we may mention as an instance Pliny’s picture of Trajan dispensing
justice in Germany—sometimes without an interpreter—while
the influence of the trade in furs, wine, and fish in introducing
Germanic words into Latin has been amply established.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Turning to Gaul in particular, we find many avenues of
Germanic influence; for, besides the big invasions of the third
and fifth centuries, we find the Goths officially settled in
Aquitaine in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 419, and the Burgundians about the same
time, in the north and north-eastern parts. It is not surprising,
therefore, to catch from Ausonius glimpses of fairly familiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
intercourse between German and Gallo-Roman in the fourth
century. His enthusiastic praise of Bissula, the Suebian maid
who was captured beyond the Rhine<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>—‘Barbara, sed quae
Latias vincis alumna pupas’—is an indication of this. Now
there is a law of Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian, given in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 370, forbidding all intermarriage. ‘Nulli provincialium’,
it says, ‘cuiuscumque ordinis aut loci fuerit, cum barbara sit
uxore coniugium: nec ulli gentilium (foreigners, i.e. not Roman)
provincialis foemina copuletur. Quod si quae inter provinciales
atque Gentiles adfinitates ex huiusmodi nuptiis exstiterint, quod
in his suspectum vel noxium detegitur, capitaliter expietur.’<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
This law, however, as Lavisse remarks,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> does not seem to have
had much effect. Such laws very rarely have. We may assume,
therefore, that there was considerable intercourse even before the
Visigoths were settled in Aquitaine.</p>

<p>Not only had points of contact been multiplied, but the
standard of civilization among the invaders had risen. Orosius
notes that the Burgundians were mild and modest enough to
treat their Gallic subjects as brothers,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and their laws dating
from the sixth century show a considerable culture. Roman
civilization and Christian morality had raised them to this level,
but they still had their own contribution to make. For they
still had their own national character and traditions and language,
and these produced blends and combinations in the already richly
blended Aquitaine which have played their part in the shaping
of the whole. Such influences cannot be reduced to specific items,
but it is plain that they were there. They left their mark (all
the more effectively because the Goths welcomed Roman culture
with open arms) on the character of the people, on their literature,
and on their language.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Even in Cicero’s day Gallic Latin had
a distinctive flavour. To Brutus he says that when he comes to
Gaul he will hear words not used at Rome, though the differences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
are not fundamental.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> By the time of Sidonius Germanic
influences have accentuated these differences. To such an
extent, says this lover of Rome to his friends, had the host of
idle and careless people increased, that they would soon have to
weep for the extinction of the Latin language, were it not for
the tiny band of scholars who might save the purity of the
Roman tongue from the rust of undignified barbarisms.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> To
Arbogast Sidonius declares<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> that Latin has perished from
Belgium and the Rhine; and though this may be a rhetorical
preparation for the antithesis ‘in te resedit’, we cannot fail to
hear in it and in the phrase ‘our vanishing culture’ the tramp
of the approaching barbarians.</p>

<p>The contribution of Germanic to the peculiar character of
Gallic Latin is traced by modern philology to the following
spheres: proper nouns, weapons and military terms, administration
and jurisdiction, animals and plants, terms of domestic
economy, and, what is more, certain abstract names (<i>affre</i>, <i>hâte</i>,
<i>guise</i>, <i>orgueil</i>, &amp;c.), and a good number of adjectives and verbs.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Looking at this Germanic influence from the point of view of
French, the decadence of Gallic in the fifth century and the
preponderance of Germanic, to omit Latin for the moment, are
accomplished facts. But from the point of view of the fourth
and fifth centuries, what we find is that philologists have never
clearly distinguished between those Germanic words which came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
in after the third-century invasions and those which were imported
in the fifth century. The fact that most of the Germanic
words recognized in French are Frankish seems to point to the
conclusion that the most important German influence came with
Chlodowig—i.e. after our period. Here, then, is a point which
we would recommend for philological research: an estimation of
the relative importance of Germanic influence in Gaul, after the
third-century invasions and after those of the fifth.</p>

<p>Sidonius has given us a few glimpses of Gothic life in Gaul
towards the end of the fifth century. Theodoric, whose ‘civilitas’
he commends,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> does not load his table with tasteless
profusion: ‘maximum tunc pondus in verbis est’. And it is to
his credit that in his case, ‘cibi arte, non pretio placent’.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> A
wise balance is kept: ‘videas ibi elegantiam Graecam, abundantiam
Gallicanam, celeritatem Italam.’ He does not go in for
those cheap amusements which were all too common as meal-time
entertainments: there is no hydraulic organ, no choir, no flute,
or lyre or performing girl.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> If we take this with Salvian’s
panegyrics on the morals of the Goths, it may not perhaps be
unjustifiable to conclude that the Gothic element gave some
stability to the moral education of Southern Gaul.</p>

<p>Intellectually, too, they stood high. It is not without significance
that Arbogast (391-2) made his nominee for the Empire
a former teacher of rhetoric. Seronatus speaks of ‘literature
among the Goths’,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and Sidonius praises Arbogast, who, though
‘potor Mosellae’ is famous for his Roman eloquence and commits
no barbarism, in spite of living among barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The greater
part of the nobility understood Latin well, though Gothic was
probably spoken in ordinary intercourse. The lower classes
among the Goths understood Latin very imperfectly. At the
collapse of the conspiracy vaguely mentioned by Sidonius<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
an interpreter is used. The persons concerned were clearly
Goths. And Ennodius speaks of an interpreter at an interview
between Euric and Epiphanius, when the latter made a speech in
Latin.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> But Latin was preponderant. It was the language of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
diplomacy<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and legislation; it was the language of a mighty
civilization, and of Placidia, the wife of Ataulf. Theodoric II
was trained by Avitus in Latin literature, and Euric encourages
the teaching of classical literature. Lampridius sang in praise
of the Gothic kings at Bordeaux, and Leo, Euric’s minister,
was famous as a rhetorician. In fact, the Visigothic court
became the last refuge of Roman letters.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Nor did the activity
of the Goths end with literature. In 484, feeling the complexity
and difficulty of the Theodosian code, they called a conference
of lawyers and ecclesiastics who produced an abridged form, with
interpretations, which was destined<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> to replace the older code
throughout the country occupied by the Goths. That there
were schools of jurisprudence in this part, notably at Arles, we
gather from Sidonius.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Fauriel thinks this revised form,
published <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 506, bore traces of the Germanic spirit and
tradition, and was, in comparison with the Roman code, ‘plus
concise et mieux rédigée’.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a large number of people in Gaul
welcomed the government of the Goths, whose influence was
thereby extended to the classes whose interest did not reach to
books and codes. For the poor, crushed by the cast-iron imperial
system, looked to the Goths as their deliverers, and the middle
classes, oppressed with taxation, welcomed any change, while
many eagerly sought the service of the Gothic government.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
‘Sed Gothicam fateor pacem me esse secutum’, says Paulinus of
Pella,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> who, though a nobleman, preferred Gothic rule, because
he felt how uncertain imperial protection was becoming. He
also mentions the ‘summa humanitas’ which the Goths showed
in shielding the people on whom they were billeted.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
speaking, he was satisfied with Gothic rule: it was quite profitable,
in spite of his many and great sufferings.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Under these circumstances it was easy to forget Rome. ‘Rome
était si loin de Bordeaux’, remarks Rocafort.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> And so Gallo-Romans
very often came to treat their Gothic neighbours on
terms of friendliness and equality.</p>

<p>But among the upper classes of the Gallo-Romans generally
Roman pride was still very strong. They held high offices at
the court of the barbarians, for whom they cherished a secret
contempt, or else retired to their great châteaux<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> (ruins of which
are still to be seen<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>) and bewailed to one another the encroachment
of the Goths, who retained, to a large extent, their lawless
and roving instinct. There is a feeling that literature and
religion (in both of which we see, though in different degrees,
the growth of a ceremonious externalism) are the only things
left. Sidonius asks Basilius to see to it that the bishops obtain
the right of ordination in those parts which the Goths have
taken, so that there may be, at any rate, a religious if not
a political bond.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> And both in religion and literature they
despised the Goths. For the Goths were Arians, and their
jargon was barbarous. The well-known epigram of the Latin
Anthology<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> expresses the attitude of mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Inter <i>hails</i> goticum, <i>scap jah matjan jah drigkan</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">non audet quisquam dignos educere versus.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>How can one write poetry, exclaims Sidonius, among people
who put rancid oil on their hair? ‘The Muse of the six-foot
metre has scorned her task, since the appearance of patrons seven
feet high.’<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> And to Philagrius he confesses: ‘barbaros vitas
quia mali putentur: ego etiamsi boni’.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>How sensitive men of Sidonius’s class were to the charge of
barbarism we may see from Avitus’s letter to Viventiolus.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Rumour whispers that in one of his sermons he has slipped into
a ‘barbarism’, and his friends are openly criticizing. ‘I confess’,
says the bishop with wounded pride, ‘that such a thing may have
happened to me. Any learning I may have had in more youthful
years is now the spoil of age, “omnia fert aetas”’—a Virgilian
quotation to indicate that, in spite of his profession to his
friend, his ‘studia litterarum’ still remain to mark his culture.
The barbarism at issue is the quantity of the middle syllable of
‘potitur’, to which he devotes most of the letter.</p>

<p>Thus to the nobleman of the fifth century, even if he was a
churchman and might, therefore, be expected to take the wider
Christian view, culture meant something essentially Roman. By
the side of this Roman culture Germanic influence must seem
small, and yet, when we remember the attitude of men like
Paulinus of Pella to the Goths, and allow a margin for Sidonius’s
prejudice, it cannot seem unimportant in the civilization of Gaul.</p>

<h3>5. <span class="smcap">Romanization of Gaul</span></h3>

<p>Having glanced at the negative side of Gallic Romanization,
it is important to look a little closer at the positive side, in order
to form an idea of the extent of Gallo-Roman education.</p>

<p>How mighty the Roman impress was is seen in the many
Roman roads, the amphitheatres, the inscriptions where Gauls
very often appear as priests of Rome and Augustus, in the
famous altar at Lyons, mentioned by Juvenal,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> on which the
sixty peoples of Gallia Comata inscribed their names after
the pacification of the country by Drusus in 12 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
formed the common sanctuary for the province, and was the
scene of regular rhetorical contests in Latin and in Greek.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
And the speech of Claudius to the Senate<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> shows how eager the
emperors were to speed on the rapidly advancing Romanization
of Gaul.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Aquitaine was the first to be Romanized.
Ammianus remarks that the shores of the Aquitanians were
easily accessible to merchants, and that their characters were
soon degraded to effeminacy, so that they easily passed under
Roman domination.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> But Lyons was the real centre of
systematic Romanization. Thence Latin spread widely among
the Gauls, who have left us no record of their Gallic Latin.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
By the fifth century the victory of Latin was complete. It was
the language of civilization, of government, of society. Slaves
brought from all parts of the world made a common language
between master and servant a necessity. Soldiers settled in
Gaul spread its influence. Finally, it was the official language
of the Church and (a fact which was most important for its
propagation) of the School.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>It is a tribute to the thoroughness of Caesar’s work that when
Classicus rebelled in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> his associates were two Julii, one
of whom tried to pass himself off as a descendant of the Dictator,
while the other assumed the insignia of the Roman Emperor.
So mighty was the Roman name that even its enemies in
attacking it desired a part of its glory. ‘Between Classicus and
the first Buonaparte’, says Freeman,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> ‘no man again dreamed
of an Empire of the Gauls.’ And Strabo had some justification
when he spoke of the Gauls as δεδουλωμένοι καὶ ζῶντες κατὰ
τὰ προστάγματα τῶν ἑλόντων αὐτοὺς Ῥωμαίων.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Not that the feeling against Rome entirely disappeared. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Gauls objected to the luxury of the Roman emperors,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and we
have such incidents as the Treveri shutting their gates to
Decentius, brother of Magnentius.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Lampridius speaks of
‘Gallicanae mentes ... durae ac pertorridae, et saepe imperatoribus
graves’.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Zosimus tells us that after the fall of the usurper
Constantine<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 411 the whole of the Armorican land cast
out its Roman rulers. But in the main the Roman machine
worked efficiently enough by keeping the border tribes busy
with feuds among themselves, and the mass of the people with
oppressive exactions. There are many references to the loyalty
of Gaul, from the exulting cry of Cicero in the <i>Philippics</i><a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> to
the enthusiasm of Rutilius Namatianus. Pliny<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> calls Narbonensis
‘Italia verius quam provincia’. Claudian represents the
whole of Gaul as fighting for Stilicho,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Gaul which supplies
the Empire with soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Before him the panegyrists of the
emperors—the majority of whom were Gauls—had been loud
in their testimonies of Gaul’s loyalty. The orator of Autun<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
boasts (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 311) that his city, rejoicing then in the imperial
title of ‘Flavia Aeduorum’, had been the only one to join the
Romans of its own free will—though Caesar records the subjugation
of the Aedui in much the same way as that of the
other tribes. Of purer fidelity than Massilia or Saguntum, the
Aedui are ‘ingenua et simplici caritate fratres populi Romani’.
The hollowness of the speaker’s rhetoric deceives no one; but it
shows that there was at least a large part of Gaul which considered
such speeches ‘the correct thing’, and that confidence
in Rome’s destiny was widely felt: the fate-appointed eternal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
city, whose menacing enemies had all been rooted out.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Much
more genuine is Rutilius. He feels that Gaul is his native
country,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> but the enthusiasm he shows for Rome is more than
the mere official utterance of a Praefect of the City. There is
real inspiration in his lines, in spite of Gibbon’s opinion that he
was only an ‘ingenious traveller’.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The great achievement of the Empire is that it made a city
of the world: ‘urbem fecisti quod prius orbis erat’. Rome, he
maintains, is greater than her deeds: ‘Quod regnas minus est
quam quod regnare mereris’. And as her buildings dazzle his

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whole of Gaul was not equally loyal. While the South
remained predominantly Roman to the end, the North, ‘audax
Germania’, Claudian calls it,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> was less friendly, and its hostility
increased as time went on.</p>

<p>The Aeduan panegyrist, who implores help for the future
from the Emperor Constantine, while he thanks him for the
benefits of the past, shows the bearing of physical features upon
this difference between North and South.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> In contrast with
the cultivated fields of the South, its ‘viae faciles’, its ‘navigera
flumina’, we find in Belgica ‘vasta omnia, inculta squalentia,
multa tenebrosa, etiam militaris vias ita confragosas et alternis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
montibus arduas atque praecipites, ut vix semiplena carpenta,
interdum vacua, transmittant’. The roads are very bad (<i>regionum
nostrarum aditum atque aspectum tam foedum tamque asperum</i>), and
even an ardent panegyrist must admit that loyalty is damped,
when, in addition to an exiguous harvest, you must experience
difficulties of transport. It is remarkable how important a part
the road plays in the Roman Empire, one way or another.
Here, barbarism on the one hand and bad roads on the other
proved a formidable combination against civilization. It is not
surprising to find, therefore, that as we go north traces of Gallo-Roman
schools become fewer, inscriptions bearing on education
almost non-existent, and Greek almost unknown.</p>

<p>But the testimony of literature to the Romanization of Gaul
is far less eloquent than that of the extant remains. The
modern traveller in Provence might well be tempted to exclaim
with Pliny ‘Italia verius quam provincia’. The theatres and
amphitheatres at Fréjus and Arles, the arch and theatre at
Orange, the temple of Augustus and Livia at Vienne, and above
all the Maison Carrée, the Porta Augusta and the Thermae at
Nîmes, and the neighbouring Pont du Gard, challenge comparison
with the great buildings of Italy and even of Rome herself.
And these are but the most notable examples of evidence
which may be found in less degree in almost every village of
Provence.</p>

<p>Outside the ‘old province’, though the evidence is naturally
less impressive in bulk and less widely spread in area, yet the
walls and gates of Autun, the amphitheatre at Paris, the Porte
de Mars at Reims, the arch at Langres, the Porte Noire and
amphitheatre at Besançon, and the theatre at remote Lillebonne,
tell the tale of Roman influence on the Tres Galliae; and to
these must be added the great buildings of Trèves which, as an
imperial capital, occupies a place apart.</p>

<p>And what is writ large on these great monuments is written no
less unmistakably in the contents of the French museums. That of
the world-famous statues of Venus three come from Narbonensis
is significant of the taste of Gallic connoisseurs. These great
masterpieces were of course imported, but the discoveries at
Martres Tolosanes attest the existence of local schools of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
sculpture.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Even if the reliefs of Gallic tombstones in the north and
centre diverge somewhat sharply from the Roman convention in
preferring the naturalistic to the allegorical in their choice of
subject, yet the form is predominantly classical. And the
readiness of Gaul to learn the industrial arts of Italy is strikingly
proved by its pottery. The manufacture of the red ‘Arretine’
ware or ‘terra sigillata’ was already flourishing among the
Ruteni in the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and met with such success
that it was actually exported to Italy, and finally displaced the
home product.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> In this useful if humble art, Gaul, like Greece,
took captive her captor.</p>

<p>The causes of this all but complete Romanization are not far
to seek. The sword of Caesar was mighty and its argument
efficient. Part of this argument the Romans always retained,
but as time went on they mingled diplomacy with their militarism.
The altar at Lyons had its persuasive side, though the spirit
that moved the orator’s tongue was no doubt quickened by the
scourge and the river in the background. Yet imperial policy
is as clearly seen here as in the utterances of the panegyrists,
who are regularly employed to publish the prince’s praises.
Caracalla’s extension of the citizenship to provincials is part of
the same policy (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 212).</p>

<p>Not to exterminate the barbarian tribes, but to bring them
within the Empire as cultivators and soldiers, was the aim of the
later emperors<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>—an aim which they sometimes followed with
ruthless cruelty.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Of Constantine the panegyrist says that he
entirely cleared Batavia of the Franks who had occupied it, and
made them live among Romans, so that they might lose not only
their arms but also their savage temper.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> He brought the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
barbarous Franks from their original homes in the distant North
to till the soil and to fill the armies of the Roman Empire.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, as Glover<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> remarks, the schoolmaster of the West
was the ally of the Empire. The elaborate system of imperial
protection in the schools had in view the important object of
Romanizing the growing generation. Besides, by increasing
lines of communication, by rendering news and books accessible,
by making intercourse secure, the emperors helped forward
Roman influence. The security which the provincial felt in the
protection of the Eternal City was one of the strongest pillars
of loyalty. The effect of Alaric’s success upon minds like those
of Jerome and Augustine, critical as they were of Pagan Rome,
is some measure of the confidence which people felt in her power.
Yet even after Rome had deserted the Gauls in the great invasions
of the fifth century, we have the picture of Sidonius’s passionate
ardour for the Roman name and his bitter grief when he ceased
to be a Roman citizen in 475.</p>

<p>‘Birth in the Gallic provinces during the fourth century
brought with it no sense of provincial inferiority. Society was
thoroughly Roman, and education and literature more vigorous,
so far as we can judge, than in any other part of the West.’<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
While we agree with this in the main, it may be questioned
whether the Roman did not sometimes tend to look on the Gaul
as a mere provincial. In the first century we find Pliny saying
that he is pleased to hear that his books are being sold at
Lyons, where he evidently does not expect so civilized a thing
as a book-shop.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Symmachus, in the fourth century, writes<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> to
a friend in Gaul ‘rusticari te asseris ... non hoc litterae tuae
sapiunt’, and adds sarcastically ‘nisi forte Gallia tua dedux
Heliconis’. And Cassiodorus (sixth century) implies that there
were some who thought that Latin literature should be confined
to Rome. ‘You have found Roman eloquence’ he writes to
a friend, ‘not in its native place, and you have learned oratory
from your Cicero in the country of the Celts. What are we to
think of those who maintain that Latin must be learnt at Rome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
and Rome only? Liguria too sends forth her Ciceros.’<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> A protest
of this kind as late as the sixth century suggests that the
idea of provincialism was pretty strong. One of the panegyrists,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
a Gaul<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> of uncertain name,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> illustrates this same tendency. And
though his words are probably as insincere as his praise of the
Emperor, yet they imply a tradition which he found it expedient
to recognize.</p>

<p>‘Full well I know how much we provincials lack of Roman
intelligence. For, indeed, to speak correctly and eloquently is
the Roman’s birthright ... our speech must ever flow from
their fountain.’<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<h3>6. <span class="smcap">Roman Education in Gaul before the Fourth Century A.D.</span></h3>

<p>The extent of Romanization in Gaul gives us a general idea
of the influence of Roman civilization in that country; for
wherever the Roman went he spread his culture. It remains to
investigate very briefly the traces of actual schools and teachers
in the times that lead up to the fourth and fifth centuries.</p>

<p>As early as the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> we hear of Gaul in connexion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
with education. ‘In provincias quoque’, says Suetonius, ‘Grammatica
penetraverat, ac nonnulli de notissimis doctoribus peregre
docuerunt, maxime in Gallia Togata.’<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Tacitus made all the
speakers in his dialogue on Famous Orators Gauls,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> except
Vipstanus Messalla, and Suetonius tells of many Gallic teachers:
Marcus Antonius Gnipho, who taught in the house of Julius
Caesar and is said to have had Cicero among his pupils;<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Valerius Cato (first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), a Gallic freedman, known as
‘the Latin siren’, who wrote a book called <i>Indignatio</i>, and
taught many youths of high rank, being especially famous as
a teacher of poetry;<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and Claudius Quirinalis of Arles,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> who
taught with great success in the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Schools were widely spread. ‘Il n’y a pas lieu de douter’,
says Bouquet,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> ‘qu’il n’y eût dès lors (first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) autant
d’écoles publiques qu’il y avait de villes principales.’ Narbonne,
stirred by the culture of the neighbouring Massilia,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Arles,
Vienne, Toulouse, Autun, Lyons, the scene of Caligula’s famous
rhetorical contests and the imperial seat before Trèves and Arles,
Trèves, Nîmes, Bordeaux, and a large number of other towns,
‘cultivated learning and produced great men’. Jullian thinks
that Bourges was probably a scholastic centre of some importance.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
Claudius, the Emperor, remarked: ‘insignes viros e Gallia
Narbonensi transivisse’.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Tradition says that Toulouse was
called Palladia on account of its love of letters,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and Martial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
rejoices that his poems are so widely read at Vienne.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> It may
not be mere rhetoric when Tacitus says that Roman education
came to Britain from Gaul, and that Agricola, in his attempt to
Romanize the Britanni, took a particular interest in their education.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
‘Iam vero principum filios liberalibus artibus erudire, et
ingenia Britannorum studiis Gallorum anteferre,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> ut qui modo
linguam Romanam abnuebant, eloquentiam concupiscerent.’
Thus the educational influence of Gaul was early great.</p>

<p>During the second century education continued to flourish.
Lucian<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> introduces a Gaul οὐκ ἀπαίδευτος τὰ ἡμέτερα ...
ἀκριβῶς Ἑλλάδα φωνὴν ἀφιείς, φιλόσοφος, ὡς οἶμαι, τὰ ἐπιχώρια,
who discourses in learned fashion on the question whether
Mercury or Hercules should be the patron god of the art of
speaking. It was the time of the wandering rhetor—‘die
zweite Sophistik’—and Greek flourished under the patronage of
the philhellenic Hadrian. Aulus Gellius has left us a picture
of the pupils escorting the sophist from place to place. ‘Nos
ergo familiares eius circumfusi undique eum prosequebamur
domum’;<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and in the case of Favorinus at Rome they went
about with him ‘spellbound, as it were, by his eloquence’.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
Intercourse was quite free and easy and not always serious: ‘in
litteris amoenioribus et in voluptatibus pudicis honestisque
agitabamus.’<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> These literary clubs set the fashion for the
rhetorical schools and perpetuated the distinctive methods of
the Greek- and Latin-speaking sophist-rhetorician—‘rhetoricus
sophista, utriusque linguae callens’.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Almost all records of the Gallic rhetors during this interesting
period have been lost. The letters of Valerius Paulinus, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Geminus, of Trebonius Rufinus to the younger Pliny, the orations
of the lawyers, the books of the famous philosopher Favorinus,
the poems of Sentius Augurinus, have all perished. Only the
work of L. Annaeus Florus has come down to us.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Yet the
general trend of education may be discerned. If one great
feature of this century was the wandering sophist, another was
the power of the Christian religion, whose influence went forth
from Lyons in particular, where Irenaeus was predominant.
‘Christi religio novam admovit oratorum ingenio facem.’<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> This
influence has been exaggerated, especially by eighteenth-century
writers. One of them lays stress on the revival of the finer
accomplishments as a result of this influence, and on the dignity
and polish of language in which the Christian writers agreed
with the ancients.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> This is manifestly an overstatement: the
Church on the whole had neither the time nor the inclination to
pay much attention to ‘elegantiora studia’; its attention was
directed to the search for truth and it is hence that its real
inspiration to education came.</p>

<p>We find imperial interest in education during this period
beginning to take a more definite form. Antoninus Pius gives
teachers’ salaries and honours,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and fixes the number of rhetors
in each town. No doubt the influence of M. Cornelius Fronto,
the famous tutor of Marcus Aurelius, the model of succeeding
generations of orators, told in this direction. In a fragment of
this teacher we have a reference which seems to point to schools
in the North during the second century. He speaks of Reims
(<i>Durocortorum</i>) as ‘illae vestrae Athenae’<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>, and it would not be
surprising if the imperial policy had selected this important
frontier town as a centre of Romanization, just as it afterwards
patronized Trèves for the same purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>In the third century a large number of churches sprang up,
whose educational value among the people must have been
important.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Pagan letters, on the other hand, had been showing
signs of decline since the end of the second century. Under
Caracalla, who in his hatred for literature put to death many
men of education,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> culture sank still lower. It is true that
Alexander Severus was a patron of literature<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> and founded
schools<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and fixed salaries, but the general trend of education
was one of decline. Barbarian invasions and civil unrest increased
this tendency.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> And so Gaul was disorganized, and amid her
disorder education grew feeble. But when in 292 Gaul passed
under the government of Constantius Chlorus, interest in culture
revived and grew strong. Constantius fixed his abode at Trèves
and actively set himself to aid the cause of education. The
school of Massilia was declining, but, on the whole, Gallic education
grew and gained individuality. Eumenius has told us at
length how much the Gallic youth owed to his interest and
protection (<i>incredibilem erga iuventutem Galliarum suarum sollicitudinem
atque indulgentiam</i>), and how thankful he is to the
Emperor who transferred him ‘from the secrets of the imperial
chambers (he had been Magister Memoriae) to the private shrines
of the Muses’.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Autun is mentioned by Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> as a centre of education in the
time of Tiberius: ‘nobilissimam Galliarum subolem, liberalibus
studiis ibi operatam’. It flourished until the last quarter of the
third century, when it was destroyed by the plundering Bagaudae.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Eumenius pleads earnestly with the Emperor for the restoration
of the famous Maeniana,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> ‘vetustissima post Massiliam bonarum
artium sedes,’<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> the university of the North even, perhaps, in
pre-Roman<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> days, just as Massilia was of the South—the Latin
university of Gaul as Massilia was the Greek. Of all the Gallic
towns, except Lyons, Autun was the soonest Romanized, though
no Roman colony had been sent there.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> It had the Aeduan
tradition of voluntary friendship with Rome. Its Gallic nobles
had renounced Celtic connexions in favour of Roman civilization.
There was a current legend that Autun had been founded by
Hercules; like the Romans, the Aeduans wanted to establish an
ancestry for themselves which did not smack of barbarism. If
Lyons in these days was the political centre, the intellectual
centre was certainly Autun.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">PAGAN EDUCATION</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>A. THE GENERAL PROSPERITY OF THE SCHOOLS IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES</h3>

<p>‘Gaul’, says Norden in his monumental work,<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> ‘was destined
to be, in a higher measure than the actual mother-country,
Italy, the support of the ancient culture during the time of the
Roman Empire and throughout the Middle Ages. Flooded with
barbarians, sown with cloisters, she held aloft the banner of the
traditional education to the glory of herself and the service of
mankind.’</p>

<p>This is true more particularly of the fourth and fifth centuries.
For the impulse given to education at the end of the third
century continued to gather momentum during the fourth. It
was a time of peace and quiet in contrast to the preceding and
the succeeding centuries.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> For more than a hundred years
Aquitaine enjoyed respite from barbarian invasions. We catch
a note of this restfulness in the pages of Ausonius. ‘I kept
clear of party-strife and conspiracies: unmarred by them was
the sincerity of my friendships’, is the happy testimony which
he puts into his father’s mouth,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and the phrase ‘otium magis
foventes quam studentes gloriae’<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> reflects the placid life of
a Bordeaux professor. Gaul had been reorganized by Maximian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
and Constantine, and this period of peace gave splendid opportunities
for the development of the imperial policy and the
latinization of Gaul. The Emperors consistently supported the
schools and encouraged literature, which gained such strength
that it overcame even the barbarians. The Visigoths accepted
its influence and attended its schools. Jullian goes so far as to
say that it was only in the fourth century that the victory of
Latin letters in Gaul was complete.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Mamertinus, in his <i>Gratiarum Actio</i> to Julian, contrasts his
own time (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 362) with that of the Republic, of which he says
‘nullum iam erat bonarum artium studium’. Military labours
and the study of law were despised, in spite of the fact that
there were men like Manlius and Scaevola. Moreover, ‘the
study of oratory was despised by the big men of the time as
being too laborious and unpractical a matter’.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> But <i>now</i>, under
Julian, all this is different and the age of gold has returned.</p>

<p>The orator is working up to a rhetorical climax, and the first
part of his picture is consequently grossly warped and exaggerated.
But the central fact of the advancement of studies is
clear and incontestable. Were it not true the rhetorician would
not have dared to use such language to a man like Julian.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was the age of the ‘ecclesia triumphans’, and
this meant fresh ideals and the access of energy (not always
wisely spent) that comes from such inspiration. In the fourth
century, and more particularly in the fifth, there was an intellectual
activity in theological and philosophical subjects which
produced a new interest in education and built up the rampart
that saved culture from entire barbarization during the darkness
of the succeeding centuries. The Church, while it rejoiced in
the overthrow of paganism, and with its enmity to paganism
often joined a hostility to pagan letters, was nevertheless the
instrument of saving the literature and the culture which it
opposed. And so, when we hear Jerome’s exultant cry at the
triumph of Christianity, we hear also the victory shout of
Roman civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>‘All the Roman temples’, says Jerome, ‘are covered with soot
and cobwebs. They who once were the gods of nations are left
in desolation with the owls and night-birds on the house-tops....
Now has even the Egyptian Serapis become Christian ... from
India and Persia and Ethiopia we daily receive multitudes of
monks; the Armenian has laid aside his quivers, the Huns learn
the Psalms, the cold of Scythia is warm with the glow of our
Faith.’<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> The Roman nobles, who set the fashion in education,
were coming over to the Church in great numbers. ‘Gracchus,
an urban prefect, whose name boasts his patrician rank, has
received baptism.’<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Paulinus of Nola, Honoratus of Lérins,
Salvian, Eucherius, Sidonius, all leaders of Christianity, were
all of noble rank. Even Ausonius professed<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> to be a Christian.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it is not surprising to find many indications
of flourishing studies in Gaul during this period. Roman
Gaul, enriched by its background of Greek, of Celtic, of Germanic
influence, became at length greater than Rome itself. Eumenius
is ready to spend his salary on the rebuilding of the Maeniana at
Autun.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> In Ausonius’s family there is much interest in education.
His father gives the impression of having been a cultured
physician,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and his grandfather, Arborius, was a student of
astrology.</p>

<p class="noindent">His aunt Aemilia lived a single life devoted to the study of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
medicine.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Herculanus, his nephew, was a teacher at Bordeaux,
though he wandered from the straight path,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> while the fame of
his uncle Arborius, the rhetorician, reached as far as Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
In 398 Claudian could use <i>doctus</i> as a conventional
epithet of the citizens of Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> It had long been the custom
of the Romans to employ Gallic teachers, and it is a striking
testimony to the pre-eminence of the schools of Gaul that
Symmachus, the crusty old patrician, conservative of the pagan
conservatives, should desire to have a Gallic tutor for his son at
Rome.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> He is not ashamed to confess his debt to Gaul. ‘I must
confess that I miss the fountain of Gallic eloquence. All my
skill (and I know its limitations) I owe to Gaul.’<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> If Rome
had retained her former importance as an educational centre, if
there had been the least chance of backing her against Gaul,
this ardent lover of the Eternal City would certainly have done
so. But Gaul at this time was rather like Scotland from Hume
to Scott: a junior partner, but with a literary culture of her
own that imparted to her a superior excellence.</p>

<p>Turning to Christian writers, we find the same testimony to
the prosperity of Gallic studies. Now this prosperity had two
aspects. There was the height to which men like Paulinus and
Sidonius rose in the attainment of knowledge, and there was the
width to which the interest in reading the pamphlets of the
Church Fathers extended. But that there was a great and
increasing interest in education cannot be denied. Neither conservative
haughtiness towards the provinces (as far as it survived)
nor the hatred of religious zeal could ignore the fact. More
than once Jerome in his <i>Chronicle</i> uses the word <i>florentissime</i>
in this connexion,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and to Rusticus he writes that he has heard
of his education at Rome, ‘post studia Galliarum quae vel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
florentissima sunt’.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Paulinus of Pella and his namesake of
Nola, whom Ausonius taught, together with men like Prosper
of Aquitaine,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> leaders in the Christian world, all owed their
early training to the flourishing pagan schools of Gaul.</p>

<p>Among the nobility letters were highly prized. Sidonius
reminds Syagrius of his descent from a poet to whom letters
would certainly have given statues.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> He admires the learning of
the praefectorian Paul, the subtleties he propounds, his elaborate
figures, the polish of his verses, the cunning of his fingers.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> In
him he sees ‘studiorum omnium culmen’. At a dinner given on the
occasion of the games, the Emperor Severus engaged in a literary
conversation with an ex-consul.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Even Seronatus aspires to
literary culture and talks about ‘Literature among the Goths’.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
In fact, owing largely to the zeal of Ecdicius, the nobility was
now becoming familiar with oratorical and poetical style.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
Thus, in spite of the invasions, the schools of the fifth century
prosper and cultivate all the branches of learning prescribed by
the rhetorical tradition.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Three tendencies have been distinguished among the Christian
schools of this period<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>: that of Sidonius which is ‘essentially
heathen with a veneer of churchmanship’; that of men like
Paulinus of Nola, who ‘jealously guards his pupils from contamination
by the Gentile classics’; and that of ‘the wiser and
more catholic teachers’ such as Hilary of Poitiers and Sulpicius
Severus (in his <i>Chronicon</i>), who are liberal enough to imitate
and benefit by the older pagan literature.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>All these sides of Christian education show an activity which
corresponds to that of the pagan schools and outlives it. Sidonius’s
letters present an interest in literature which is very often
shallow, but never slack. He is continually sending round
specimens of his literary efforts to his friends, and is assiduous
in writing polished epitaphs<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> or inscriptions that will live on
the plate if not in the memory of men.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> There is one thing
that his friends must never neglect, the reading of many books:
‘opus est ut sine dissimulatione lectites, sine fine lecturias’.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>Even among the stricter Christians there was generally an
interest in learning outside theology. ‘In the East and in the
West’, says Montalembert,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> ‘literary culture, without being by
right inseparably attached to the religious profession, became in
fact a constant habit and a special distinction of the greater
number of monasteries.’ In every monastery there was established,
as time went on, a library, a studio for copying manuscripts
and a school. The monasteries, in fact, became schools
where science and profane learning were taught, as well as
theology, and where Latin was studied at the same time with
Hebrew and Greek.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> This teaching was sometimes primitive
and defective, and the picture is not so glowing as Montalembert
suggests; but there were, at any rate, the beginnings of better
things, the interest in education, and the means of protecting
a valuable culture. The letters of Jerome to the Gallic women
who ask him questions about the scriptures,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and his letters to
Laeta on the education of her daughter Paula,<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> are indications
of a similar activity, no less than Caesarius’s exhortations to
reading and study,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> the Christian pamphlets on difficult points<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
which passed from hand to hand,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and Eucherius’s list of answers
to the questions of his son Salonius.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The pedagogic significance
of such works of exposition is apparent.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>The tendencies to exclude and to imitate pagan literature
sometimes merge into each other in the same writer. It was
difficult for the Christian teachers to make up their minds
definitely about pagan literature, placed as they were, in a time
of extreme partisanship, between the attractiveness of pagan
letters and the repulsiveness of pagan faith and practice. But
if we are to distinguish a class of moderate men and take
Sulpicius Severus as a type (though outside the <i>Chronicon</i> his
opposition to pagan literature is aggressively stated<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>) we may
maintain that the middle party, too, was interested in culture
and not cooled in its ardour by the moderation it displayed.
Sulpicius makes Postumianus describe how widely the <i>Life of
Martin</i> was read. Taken from Gaul to Rome, it travelled
thence to Carthage, Alexandria, Nitria, the Thebaid, Memphis.
Even in the middle of the African desert an old man was found
reading it.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The Church, therefore, had its share in Gaul’s
widespread interest in education during this time.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The evidence of the inscriptions is disappointing. With such
a general interest in culture we should have expected more
frequent references to teachers and their activities. As it is, we
find only a few inscriptions, and those in Southern Gaul, that
bear on the subject. There is the epitaph of a grammarian at
Vienne,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and the lament of a woman for her foster-son, whom
she had educated, in the same town.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>At Lyons there has been discovered a reference to the
<i>martyrium</i>, the famous Church or Church-school dedicated to
Irenaeus. ‘In hoc tomolo requiiscit bone (= bonae) memoriae

Dominicus studied here for seven years. Boissieu suggests that
he may have been one of the ‘caterva scholasticorum’ at the
feast of St. Just described by Sidonius.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>If Gaul as a whole was so famous for education, it is worth
while inquiring which the particular centres of Gallic culture
were.</p>

<p>It is evident that Aquitaine was the most distinguished of the
provinces. We have seen that Jerome expressly mentions its
teachers;<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> and Sulpicius Severus makes the Gaul in his <i>Dialogues</i>
apologize for the rusticity which Aquitanians must needs find in
his speech.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Aquitaine was the focus of Roman culture, the
marrow of Gaul, as Salvian calls it.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Symmachus mentions a
certain Dusarius, a professor of medicine in Aquitaine,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and many
of Ausonius’s professors taught there: Staphylius at Auch,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
Tetradius in Angoulême,<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Anastasius<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> and Rufus<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> at Poitiers,
and Arborius at Toulouse, on the border.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> But the most famous
city of Aquitaine, the intellectual capital of Gaul during the
fourth century, was Bordeaux. There had been a gradual evolution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
of schools to the West.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Massilia, with the schools of the
South-East, which were largely dependent on her influence, was
declining, and her power passed to the West, and, in a lesser
degree, to the North. Bordeaux had been a great commercial
centre<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> in the three previous centuries. It was the point at
which goods were transhipped for the river traffic to the
Mediterranean.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> It had a flourishing trade with Spain and
Britain, and many visitors came from Germany and the East.
This traffic brought riches and the bustle of commerce. Buildings
and monuments sprang up. But there comes a change.
Towards the middle of the third century, when the emperors
were weak and military discipline slack, the Barbarians renewed
their attacks. For some twenty years Gaul defended herself;
but the imperial protection grew feebler, and in 273 she was
abandoned to the invaders. They arrived in Aquitaine in 276
or 277, and Bordeaux shared in the general devastation. The
ruin was terrible; though not described by the historians, its
traces remain to the present day. ‘L’œuvre de trois siècles
disparut en quelques jours.’<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>From the ruins a new Bordeaux rose. Her previous activities
were suspended; her commerce failed. The desire for money
was changed into a desire for knowledge, and there was no loss
of intensity. Jullian<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> remarks on the frequency of such a transformation
among the great cities of history. Carthage, Antioch,
Alexandria, Athens, Massilia passed through similar changes.
The school was the last phase of their life. And so Bordeaux
from being an ‘emporium’ became an ‘auditorium’.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the school of Bordeaux (about which
we naturally know more than about all the rest together) became
famous in the fourth century, but when exactly it was founded
we cannot tell. There must have been many elementary schools
previously, though no trace is left. Funeral monuments show
children carrying the rolls of the grammarian’s school; but they
may be representations of slave-teachers attached to the household.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Probably the school of Bordeaux was founded by Maximian
and Constantius at the beginning of the fourth century. For
then, particularly, after the failure of imperial protection, it was
a necessary part of imperial policy to revive the confidence and
goodwill of the Gauls. It may be noted, too, that the professors
whom Ausonius commemorates had mostly died during his lifetime;
which seems to show that the professorial régime at
Bordeaux belonged to the fourth century;<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> for Ausonius in the
Preface and the Epilogue to his <i>Commemoratio</i> certainly gives the
impression that he is going through the whole list of the ‘professores
Burdigalenses’ as a duty (<i>officium</i><a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>) which is inspired by
‘carae relligio patriae’.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Thus it was that Aquitaine became
‘le dernier refuge des lettres antiques’.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>If Bordeaux was the intellectual, Trèves (and afterwards,
Arles) was the political capital of Gaul during this period; and
the presence of the emperors in those cities naturally fostered
education, for education (as has been pointed out) was part of the
imperial programme. As the fourth century went on Trèves
eclipsed Autun ‘sedem illam liberalium artium’,<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> which had
flourished exceedingly under Eumenius at the beginning of the
century, but seems to have declined after his death. The
imperial decrees were particularly partial to Trèves. It is as
though the emperors felt the need of an intellectual as well as
a military outpost on the German frontier. But in spite of
every favour and facility, in spite of a brilliant court and fine
buildings, this object was never accomplished. Owing to its
mixed and fluctuating population and its position on the border,
it remained a predominantly military town.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Nevertheless its
schools were famous, and Ausonius associates it with Roman
rhetoric:</p>

<p>It is curious to find that at the beginning of our period, in
which we have tried to demonstrate the supremacy of the Gallic
schools, there was a tradition that the Gauls were dull and slow
of understanding, and that this opinion persists in the writings
of Jerome.</p>

<p>The case of the ‘advocatus diaboli’ may be briefly put. Julian,
in his satire on the citizens of Antioch, constantly speaks of the
boorishness of the Gauls, whom he calls<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Κελτοί or Γαλάται.
To Alypius, the brother of Caesarius, he writes of the barbarous
Muse of Gaul (ταῦτά σοι Γαλλικὴ καὶ βάρβαρος Μοῦσα προσπαίζει),
and in the <i>Misopogon</i> the Celts (and he is thinking of
the Gauls among whom he had lived) are classed with Syrians,
Arabs, Thracians, Paeonians, and Mysians—a stock which is
utterly lacking in culture—ἄγροικον, αὐστηρόν, ἀδέξιον ... ἂ
δὴ πάντα ἐστὶ δείγματα δεινῆς ἀγροικίας.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Referring to his
residence among the barbarous Celts like a hunter surrounded by
wild beasts,<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> he says he is ἀγριώτρος than Cato in proportion
as the Celts are more uncivilized than the Romans; and the
Antiochean is represented as flinging the taunt into Julian’s
face: ταῦτα ἐνόμισας Θρᾳξὶ νομοθετεῖν ... ἤ τοῖς ἀναισθήτοις
Γαλάταις.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>Now all these references are sarcastic: ‘the boorish Gauls
could put up with my eccentricities, but Antioch, forsooth, was
too polished and cultured to tolerate them!’ The satire does
not deny the barbarism of the Gauls; it merely establishes the
vanity of the Antiocheans. But the passages quoted show the
ἄγροίκοι is accepted as the current estimation of the Gauls;
and even if Julian did not really believe it, obviously there was
a body of opinion which did. Nor is it mere ἀγροικία, lack of
culture, which may be due to lack of opportunity, that is imputed
to them: it is also ἀναισθησία, dullness, with which they are
charged. This part of the tradition finds support elsewhere.
Martial had called Bordeaux ‘crassa’,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> and Gallic credulity was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
proverbial.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Jerome says in his commentary on the Epistle to
the Galatians<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> that it was no wonder they were so stupid, seeing
that their ancestors, the Gauls, had that reputation—‘cum <i>et</i>
Hilarius Latinae eloquentiae Rhodanus, Gallus ipse et Pictavis
genitus, in Hymnorum carmine Gallos indociles vocet’. The <i>et</i>
is significant, and also seems to imply a tradition to the effect
that the Gauls were stupid. It is interesting to find that a
French scholar and patriot, who has studied the schools of Gaul
with care, is inclined to accept Martial’s judgement for the
smaller towns.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>In estimating the worth of this opinion, we must first of all
discount a good deal of what Julian says. His mind was saturated
with Hellenic philosophy and Hellas was the passion of his
life. Hence he naturally despised Roman culture, and still more
the Gauls whom the Romans contemned. The Greek idea of
βάρβαροι would be strong in a mind like Julian’s. He did not
mingle with the provincials; by the liberality of Eusebia, he
says,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> he was constantly surrounded by Greek books, so that
Gaul and Germany became for him a Μουσεῖον Ἑλληνικόν. He
would therefore be distinctly prejudiced, and incapable of appreciating
the qualities or the culture of the Gallic mind.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is another and an opposite tradition. Caesar
distinctly testifies to their exceptional cleverness: ‘est summae
genus sollertiae atque ad omnia imitanda atque efficienda,
quae a quoque traduntur, aptissimum’,<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> and Diodorus is as
clear: ταῖς δὲ διανοίαις ὀξεῖς καὶ πρὸς μάθησιν οὐκ ἀφυεῖς.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
Clement of Alexandria, in his attempt to show that the Greeks
by no means had the monopoly of philosophy, even went so far
as to say, with manifest exaggeration, that the Gauls preceded
and instructed the Greeks in philosophy,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and Claudian, disagreeing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
at any rate with the charge of dullness, in so far as slowness
of spirit is suggested, applied to Gaul the adjective <i>animosa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Caesar tells us that the Gallic liveliness of spirit manifested
itself in a curiosity about distant lands, an eagerness to learn from
travellers, whom they detained, even against their will, plying
them with many questions on every subject. In the towns
a crowd would gather around some newly arrived merchant and
compel him to describe the countries of his travel and their
affairs.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>This is the kind of curiosity that makes for knowledge and
science, and it is hard to reconcile with the characteristics of
dullness and stupidity. The width and general soundness of
Caesar’s observation gives to his testimony a value which the
other statements lack, for they are mostly founded on hearsay or
particular cases. With regard to Hilary’s statement, Jung
points out that the Pictavi seem from Ausonius to have been
very backward in letters. Eight epigrams are directed against
Rufus, rhetor at Poitiers, jibing at his lack of culture,<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> while
another Pictavian teacher, Anastasius, was not much of a
success.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> ‘Can we wonder’, he concludes, ‘that Hilary calls
the Gauls unteachable in the singing of hymns, when he himself
was born at Poitiers?’<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>But a tradition applied to a whole nation, and dating from the
early days of the Empire, cannot be explained by a few particular
cases. The motives that prompted particular writers to accept
the tradition may be particular, but its origin must be sought in
some more general principle. It was an attitude of mind, an
habitual way of looking at things that was responsible. It was
the ingrained pagan idea of ‘barbari’ (increased, perhaps, in the
case of the Gauls by their reputation for warlike impetuosity),<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
the idea which Christian writers like Paul and Clement of
Alexandria set themselves to combat, the idea of a chosen people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and a chosen culture. It was a habit of mind which did not
imply enmity or hatred: sometimes it did not even imply contempt.
It was just the tradition of superiority (largely true),
grown customary in the minds of a ruling people whose customs
and language other nations accepted. But just because it had
an element of truth in it, there was a danger of its being made
universal, a chance that it might blind the ruler to the individuality
of the subject and preclude a sympathetic study of the
provincial. It is this attitude, and its attendant misunderstanding,
together with the general impression which the large number of
country people would make on the dweller in the metropolis, that
are responsible for such judgements as Martial’s <i>crassa</i>. But
there can be no doubt that during our period this surprising
opinion must have been less commonly held and less generally
applied, in view of Gaul’s growing importance as a teacher of
the Empire.</p>

<h3>B. INSIDE THE SCHOOL</h3>

<h4>(i) <span class="smcap">The Substance and Methods of Primary Education</span></h4>

<p>The tradition of the Roman schools was so old, and had been
so whole-heartedly accepted by the Gauls, that we find only
scattered references to the actual details of instruction, and those
of a superficial, allusive kind. For even when we have a man
like Ausonius who deals directly with education, the assumption
always is that the reader is thoroughly familiar with the practical
facts of the schools, and the aim is generally to impress by style
or rhetorical device, and never to give a serious exposition. We
must be content, therefore, to fill in the account with the known
facts of Roman education.</p>

<p>We have no lively picture of the Gallic boy going to school,
such as Lucian gives us in the case of Greece. But in our
period we possess something similar in the orations of Libanius,
the sophist of Antioch. He describes how the boy began his
day’s work at Antioch in the fourth century. Having rubbed
the sleep from his eyes (ἀφυπνίσας) the paedagogus wakes the
boy and leads him to his studies (ὑπάγει τῷ λύχνῳ). A great
deal depends on these paedagogi, and respect is due to them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
(οὕς αἰδεῖσθαι νόμος ἦν). They are next to the teachers in
honour (ἐν τιμαῖς οὗτοι μετὰ τοὺς διδασκάλους), and in some
ways their work is more important; for, whereas the teacher
sees the pupil only during school-hours, the paedagogue is always
with him, protecting him from evil influences (φρουροὶ τῆς
ἀνθούσης ἡλικίας ... ἀπελαύοντες τοὺς κακῶς ἐρῶντας), sharing
his labours and taking the father’s place when the latter has to
be away on business for the whole day. He repeats the boy’s
lessons with him, shouts at him, shows him the rod, shakes the
strap, and reminds him by his efforts of the lesson which the
master has taught him (reading ληφθέν). When his charge is
ill, he acts as nurse (μικρὸν γὰρ ἐἰπεῖν τροφούς), sits by the
bedside and supplies his wants. The grief of the paedagogi at
the death of their charges is described, and we hear of memorials
erected by them in honour of their wards.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>How far exactly all this applied to the Western Empire in
general, and to Gaul in particular, it is impossible to say. But
the general similarity of educational methods throughout the
Empire makes a supposition that something of the kind was
found in Gaul in our period almost certain. Much less vivid
and intimate is the picture in Ausonius’s epistle to his grandson,
for it is almost entirely concerned with stereotyped things—like
discipline and school-subjects. Sidonius gives an epitome of
a typical education, in the schools of the Gallic aristocrats. He
marks the literary and poetic home-atmosphere of the cultured
noble. Writing to Constantius he says with rhetorical and unintentionally
humorous exaggeration: ‘And you the Muses took
squealing from your mother and dipped into the glassy waters
of Hippocrene. There, beneath the babbling stream, you then
drank liberally letters—not water.’<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Then came the actual school:
‘all the training of the grammarian, and all the instructions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of the rhetorician.’ The crown of imperial service was set upon
this training: ‘the court of the prince brought the young
man into prominence.’<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> And, finally, fame was sought in military
duties. Comfort and the charm of delicate and varied delights
smiled upon the boy. Sidonius is enthusiastic about the stories
at the dinner-table, the lampoons and the gaiety of this social
atmosphere, the mingled wit and serious talk<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> which filled the
home, and he rejoices in the games with which it abounded—ball,
and hoop and rattling dice:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The home influence of the Gallic nobleman in creating a
literary interest in his son was probably considerable, in view of
the general honour in which letters were held. Sidonius taught
his son comic metres from Terence and Menander, and apparently
the resulting enjoyment was mutual.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> When Paulinus of Pella
expresses his debt to his parents for their skill and zeal in
educating him, his references are touched with genuine emotion.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The constant discussion of literary topics such as we find in
Ausonius and Sidonius must have made the homes of their class
as much of a <i>ludus litterarum</i> as the schoolroom, just as among
the Christians of lower social standing the lively interest in
theological discussion must have given an impetus in many
cases to the thought of the child. Heredity, too, must have
played a part. Families in which the rhetorical education had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
become traditional produced children whose minds were naturally
inclined to take an interest in study.</p>

<p>For the sons, therefore, of these noblemen (and in dealing
with the Gallic schools it is with the nobility, chiefly, that we
have to do) home circumstances were an incentive to the activities
of the school. But what, precisely, were these activities?
Paulinus of Pella gives a general description.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> From his earliest
years (<i>ipsius alphabeti inter prope prima elementa</i><a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>) he was taught
the meaning and the value of culture, the ten special marks
which distinguish the uneducated, and all the faults of unsocial
or uncultured boorishness (<i>vitia</i> ἀκοινονόητα).<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> He was trained
in the classic education of Rome (<i>Roma</i> ... <i>servata vetustas</i>) and
found pleasure in it as an old man, though his age witnessed its
decline.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> He went to school (the school of Bordeaux made
famous by Ausonius) in his sixth year, and was made to read
‘dogmata Socratus (Σωκράτους) et bellica plasmata Homeri’
together with the wanderings of Ulysses. Then he passed on to
Vergil, which he found difficult because he had been accustomed
to speak his native Greek to the servants of the house.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At fifteen<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> we find him still at the school of the grammarian:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Argolico pariter Latioque instante magistro.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was just about the age at which he should have passed on to
the rhetorical school, but a fever laid him low, and left him so
weak that the doctor ordered a complete rest.</p>

<p>Such is the general impression that the primary education of
the day made on an ordinary boy; and we may verify his
account by comparing with it the statement of a teacher. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the foundation subjects of the elementary school comes the
faculty of ‘Grammar’. ‘Grammatikê’ is the art which deals
with ‘grammata’ or letters. These mankind invented, ‘trying
to escape from his mortality’, and seeking to get beyond the
tyranny of the passing present. ‘Instead of being content with
his spoken words, ἔπεα πτερόεντα, which fly as a bird flies and
are past, he struck out the plan of making marks on wood or
stone or bone or leather or some other material, significant
marks, which should somehow last on charged with meaning, in
place of the word that had perished.’<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> The injunction of
Ausonius to his grandson<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> ‘perlege quodcumque est memorabile’
is the motto of this faculty. Almost any subject could fall
under it, but the chief emphasis was laid on the poets and on
the orators. Ausonius recommends starting with Homer<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> and
Menander,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> with Horace, Vergil, and Terence to follow.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> A
study of the kind of authors read in the schools shows that the
poets were more frequently used than the prose writers. Mythology,
accordingly, loomed so large that Tertullian made its
excessive study one of the chief charges against the pagan
schools.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Vergil is the influence which permeates the style of
everybody, the mainstay of the grammarian, the genius of the
schoolroom. Commentators have exhausted themselves in piling
up the Vergilian references in Ausonius, Paulinus of Pella,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
Sidonius, Macrobius, and in every writer of note during this
time, pagan as well as Christian. Indeed, it would not be unfair
to say that Vergil, with Homer and Varro, ruled the school.
Sidonius refers particularly to Terence,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> whom he loves to quote,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
while Horace,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Plautus,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Menander,<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and a host of others are
mentioned as familiar friends.</p>

<p>The poets, then, in a broad sense, form one big division of
‘Grammar’: Ausonius further recommends History, ‘res et
tempora Romae’.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> He evidently considered these two divisions
important, for at the end of the Commemoratio Professorum<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> he
again mentions ‘historia’ and ‘poeticus stilus’ at the head of
a list of subjects in which the teachers of Bordeaux attained
renown. It seems strange, at first sight, that the orators are
not mentioned<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> in Ausonius’s scheme. But Ausonius meant
them to be included under ‘historia’ (how could they read the
Catilinarian conspiracy without Cicero?), and it is apparent from
the frequent and familiar references to Cicero in Sidonius and
Ausonius (not to mention Jerome), and the direct imitation of
him in the Panegyrists, that ‘Tully’ as well as Demosthenes
was extensively studied. Philosophy came in as a make-weight
in the midst of this literary atmosphere.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>Thus the concurrence of a master and a pupil of Bordeaux
gives us an idea of the <i>general</i> scope of primary education.
When we try to look a little closer, we find it difficult to get
a detailed view. In elementary education especially there is
a general reticence, an assumption that the things that existed
before continued to exist, and who is ignorant of the order which
the Roman tradition prescribes? In this order the school of the
<i>litterator</i> or elementary master came first, then the school of the
grammaticus, and, finally, that of the rhetor.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Quintilian was the last great Roman writer on pedagogy, and
his influence may be traced on pagan and Christian masters
alike. He was regarded as the model of school-eloquence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Ausonius addresses the most famous of the Bordeaux professors,
Minervius, as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Alter rhetoricae Quintiliane togae;<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and he speaks of the distinguished sons of Gaul as having been
students under Quintilian’s system of education:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Quos praetextati celebris facundia ludi</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even Jerome said that he owed part of his education to Quintilian,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
and the affected Ennodius thought so much of him that
he called him ‘eloquentissimum virum’, and thought that though
against lesser men one might argue a fictitious case, it was still
a question whether it was right to do so against Quintilian.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
As an authority on style he was evidently much respected.
Sidonius means to pay the very highest compliment when he
says of the rhetor Severianus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Et sic scribere non minus valentem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marcus Quintilianus ut solebat;<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and Jerome tells us that Hilary of Poitiers imitated the style
and the number of Quintilian’s twelve books.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>This being the position of Quintilian in the educational world
of Gaul, we are not surprised to find traces of his influence
everywhere. According to his precept,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> the master still held
the hand of the little one as he traced the letters on wax,<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> and
afterwards on papyrus or parchment.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The children still went
to school, no doubt, as Horace tells, carrying their tablets in
their satchels (<i>loculi</i>, <i>capsae</i>), which were borne, in the case of
wealthy parents, by a <i>capsarius</i>.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>There were special masters (<i>librarii</i>) to teach book-copying.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
A marble tablet found at Auch<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> bears an inscription to one
Afranius Graphicus (skilled in writing), a teacher, and in particular
a teacher of copying, who numbered among his accomplishments
proficiency in the game of draughts, and Marquardt<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
quotes a number of instances from the <i>Corpus</i>. Very important
among the various forms of writing for the fourth and fifth
centuries—the age of bureaucratic officialdom—was stenography.
Here, too, there were special masters (<i>notarii</i>) who at the same
time practised it as their vocation. Again, the <i>Corpus</i> has
frequent references.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Ausonius composed a poem on his shorthand
writer, whose skill was evidently great,<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> and when Sidonius
made his epigram on the towel there was a scribe at hand
(apparently a <i>notarius</i>) who took down his words.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> As far as the
method of reading was concerned, Quintilian’s counsel no doubt
still held good. He had advised learning the sound and the
form of the letters simultaneously,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> and the use of the synthetic
method, passing from the letter to the syllable, from the syllable
to the word, from the word to the sentence.</p>

<p>The last subject of the elementary school was Arithmetic,
a favourite subject with the hard-headed Romans. Counting
on the fingers was common in olden times, and as late as the
seventh century we find Bede writing a work ‘de loquela per
gestum digitorum et temporum ratione’,<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> which points to an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
elaborate system of computation on the fingers. There were
special teachers (<i>calculatores</i>) for advanced pupils, and the instruments
used were the <i>abacus</i> or <i>tabula</i>, a board marked with lines
which signified tens, hundreds, thousands, &amp;c., according as the
counters (<i>calculi</i>) were put on them. Figures were sometimes
drawn on a board sprinkled with sand.</p>

<p>When the boy had got beyond this elementary training, he
entered upon the studies of the grammaticus. Now the school-training
as a whole after the fourth century is said to have been
based on the seven liberal arts of Martianus Capella, described in
his marriage of Mercury and Philologia. This work had for its
foundation Varro’s ‘IX libri disciplinarum’, and had an influence
which went down through the Middle Ages. But in the department
of the grammarian there were no neatly divided compartments
for Grammar, Rhetoric, Dialectic, Arithmetic, Geometry,
Astronomy, and Music, each with its special master. Grammarians
specialized in one branch or another (as Victorius at
Bordeaux in antiquarian research<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>), and the edicts of the emperors
speak of special masters in shorthand, book-copying, arithmetic,
architecture.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> But there is no ground for thinking that these
were to be found in the ordinary school: it is much more likely
that they existed to train slaves or specialists for particular posts
in the imperial offices. It is hardly conceivable that Ausonius
should have dealt with some thirty Bordeaux teachers (of whom
several were grammarians) without indicating such a division,
had it existed.</p>

<p>The actual method of conducting the lesson is indicated by
Eumenius. ‘Ibi’ (in the new schools of Autun) ‘adulescentes
optimi discant, nobis quasi sollemne carmen praefantibus.’<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
teacher would select a passage and read it out slowly to his
pupils with proper attention to punctuation, pronunciation,
expression, and metre.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Clearness and effectiveness of intonation
were specially practised with a view to the later rhetorical
declamations. But the reason for the universal stress on elocution
in antiquity went deeper than the exigencies of practical life.
The written words had a soul which the grammaticus by reading
strove to revive. ‘The office of the art “Grammatikê” is so to
deal with the Grammata as to recover from them all that can be
recovered of that which they have saved from oblivion, to reinstate
as far as possible the spoken word in its first impressiveness and
musicalness.’<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Such, as Professor Murray points out, is the
doctrine of the official teachers. Dionysius Thrax (who was the
first to write a τέχνη γραμματική), in enumerating the six parts
of Grammatikê, mentions as the most essential reading aloud
κατὰ προσῳδίαν, ‘with just the accent, the cadences, the expression,
with which the words were originally spoken, before
they were turned from λόγοι to γράμματα, from winged words
to permanent letters’.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Ausonius makes a special point of it to
his grandson:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Do you with varied intonation read</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A host of verses; let your words succeed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each other with the accent and the stress</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your master taught you. Slurring will repress</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sense of what you’re reading; and a pause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Adds vigour to an overburdened clause.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This was the framework of every lesson.</p>

<p>The reading was followed by the exposition (<i>enarratio</i>), grammatical,
historical, philosophical, scientific, artistic, or literary.
The master would tell his class the substance of the passage, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
require them to turn verse into prose.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Books were not always
forthcoming, and then dictation (practised also for its own sake)
would be resorted to. At this time it was, perhaps, less common
than in Horace’s day<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> owing to the multiplication of books.
Learning by heart and writing exercises (<i>sententiae</i>, <i>chriae</i>) such
as were practised in the rhetor’s school were among the obvious
methods employed.</p>

<p>Philology, of course, was in its infancy. It was based on
Varro who had propounded such theories as ‘testamentum a
testatione mentis’, ‘lucus a non lucendo’. There were two
tendencies: that of the Romanists, who wished to derive everything
from the Italian languages, and that of the Hellenists,
who sought to prove that the origin of all words was Greek.
There were also the ‘Anomalists’, who believed in the principle
of change, and, like Horace, referred everything to custom, the
controller and corrupter of words, and the ‘Analogists’, who
believed in the principle of immobility, and proposed to subjugate
custom to a fixed law of reason which operated by analogy.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
How much in the dark even the best and soberest of grammarians
were on the subject may be judged from Servius’s commentary
on Vergil: on <i>Georg.</i> i. 17 ‘Maenala, mons Arcadiae, dictus
ἀπὸ τῶν μήλων, id est ab ovibus’; on <i>Georg.</i> i. 57 ‘Sabaei
populi ... dicti Sabaei ἀπὸ τοῦ σέβεσθαι’; on <i>Aen.</i> i. 17
‘“thensa”<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> autem cum aspiratione scribitur ἀπὸ τοῦ θείου’.</p>

<p>Literary criticism, the κρίσις ποιημάτων of Dionysius Thrax,<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
also played a part. The discussions in Macrobius represent an
advanced stage of the sort of thing which was begun in the
schools. Servius<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> discusses whether Vergil wrote ‘Scopulo infixit’
or ‘Scopulo inflixit’, and in Aulus Gellius we have questions
raised as to Vergil’s use of <i>tris</i> and <i>tres</i>, and Cicero’s use of
<i>peccatu</i> and <i>peccato</i>, <i>fretu</i> and <i>freto</i>.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Again, Servius considers
Probus’s doubts as to Vergil’s invocation to Jove as ‘hominum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
rerumque aeterna potestas’.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> But, on the whole, such a critical
attitude is rare. The commentator, and therefore the grammarian,
is chiefly concerned with a mass of rather simple and diffuse
exposition. The references are mainly to Lucretius, Horace,
Pliny, Terence, Hesiod, and, most of all, to Homer. Grammatical
notes, especially figures of speech, and geographical
references are frequent and ample. Historical allusions, on the
other hand, are rather slight. The critical faculty, then, was
not very much alive. Indeed, one would hardly expect it to be
from the general tone of the age, and from Servius’s own statement
of the teacher’s duty. ‘In exponendis auctoribus haec
consideranda sunt: poetae vita, titulus operis, qualitas carminis,
scribentis intentio, numerus librorum, ordo librorum, explanatio.’<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
The grammarian thus moves on a fairly low plane. To him,
‘intentio Vergilii haec est, Homerum imitari, et Augustum laudare
a parentibus’. The higher thought, the fundamental inspiration
of the poem, ‘tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem’, is
omitted altogether.</p>

<p>Of the text-books used, by far the most famous<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> was that of
Donatus, who taught Jerome about the middle of the fourth
century.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> He was the model of succeeding writers and his name
became a synonym for grammar. His work consisted of (1) an
<i>ars minor</i> for the elementary school, containing the parts of
speech; (2) an <i>ars maior</i>, divided into three parts (<i>a</i>) ‘de voce, de
littera, de syllaba, de pedibus, de tonis, de posituris’ (punctuation);
(<i>b</i>) another treatment of the parts of speech; (<i>c</i>) ‘de barbarismo,
de solecismo, de ceteris vitiis, de metaplasmo (grammatical
irregularity), de schematibus (figures of speech), de tropis’.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
We hear of a ‘Donatus provincialis’<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> which was used in Gaul,
and it may well be that Jerome’s influence in the provinces
served to spread the popularity of Donatus, especially when
supported by the Roman tradition, though his work must have
obtained a footing in the schools even on its own merits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>Agroecius (fifth century), whose ‘disciplina’ is praised by
Sidonius,<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> wrote a book on orthography,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> which was intended to
supplement a work on the same subject by Flavius Caper. And
we hear of Dositheus’s <i>Chrestomathia</i> or collection of passages
from literature, intended for Greek students and written in both
languages,<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> as a common text-book of the later Empire. Jerome
mentions Sinnius Capito as an authority on antiquities who was
still read in his day,<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> and therefore, considering the universality
of the rhetorical tradition, probably used in the schools of Gaul.
Some of his fragments may be taken as typical of the scope and
character of the grammarian’s teaching. ‘Docet (Sin. Capit.)
“pluria” Latinum esse, “plura” barbarum. Pluria sive plura
absolutum esse et simplex, non comparativum.’<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> A solecism is
defined as ‘impar atque inconveniens compositura partium orationis’.
He does not neglect derivation: ‘pacem a pactione
condicionum putat dictam Sinnius Capito’,<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> and in his philology
a place is given to phonetics. ‘De syllabis, “f” praeponitur
liquidis, nulla alia de semivocalibus; nam praeponitur liquidis
duabus sola “f”; praeponitur “l” litterae, si dicas Flavius ...
est libellus de syllabis, legite illum ... Sinni est liber
Capitonis.’<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>Grammar, in the narrow sense, was naturally part of the
grammarian’s work. ‘<i>Nec</i> coniunctionem grammatici fere dicunt
esse disiunctivam, ut “nec legit nec scribit”, cum si diligentius
inspiciatur, ut fecit Sinnius Capito, intelligi possit eam positam
esse ab antiquis pro <i>non</i> ut et in XII est....’<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> His remarks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
on the verse of Lucilius,<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> ‘nequam aurum est’, &amp;c., are an
example of the ordinary exposition so plentifully illustrated in
Servius, handed down from one generation of grammatici to
another. His opinion is quoted also on historical questions:
‘Sardi venales (<i>alius alio nequ</i>)ior. Sinnius Capito ait Ti.
Gracchum consulem, collegam P. Valeri Faltonis, Sardiniam
Corsicamque subegisse, nec praedae quicquam aliud quam mancipia
captum....’<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Constitutional history interests him:
‘Tertia haec est interrogandi species, ut Sinnio Capitoni videtur,
pertinens ad officium et consuetudinem senatoriam; quando
enim aliquis sententiam loco suo iam dixerat, et alius postea
interrogatus quaedam videbatur ita locutus....’<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>Nor did he omit antiquarian tradition: ‘Sexagenarios (<i>de ponte
olim deiciebant</i>): exploratissimum illud est causae quo tempore
primum per pontem coeperunt comitiis suffragium ferre, iuniores
conclamaverunt ut de ponte deicerentur sexagenarii qui iam nullo
publico munere fungerentur ...’,<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> and he is invoked as an
authority on traditional law: ‘Sinnius Capito ait cum civis
necaretur, institutum fuisse ut Semoniae res sacra fieret vervece
bidente....’<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Such were the shapers of the material taught
in the schools. They epitomized the learning Varro had left,
and boiled down the Vergilian commentaries of Servius, Macrobius,
and Fulgentius. And if we do not know their number and
their works too precisely, we may be fairly sure of the trend of
their teaching. We may therefore leave them, adding just
a word about dictionaries. M. Verrius Flaccus, the head of the
court library under Augustus, had written a work <i>De Verborum
Significatu</i> in alphabetical order. Each letter took up several
volumes. And in the middle of the second century, Pompeius
Festus made an extract of this in twenty volumes, of which only
a small part has been preserved, the original being wholly lost.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
Verrius’s work was a standard one, as is shown by the frequent
references to it in the grammarians.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> It was frequently amplified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
and revised. ‘Scribonius Aphrodisius’, Suetonius tells us,<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> ‘was
a teacher and a contemporary of Verrius, whose books on orthography
he edited, criticizing his scholarship and his character.’
But it remained the foundation, and modifications of it must
have been used by the teachers of the Gallic schools.</p>

<p>Two of the subjects over which the grammarian paused in his
exposition may be noticed. Blümner remarks<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> that geography
was not a school subject, and Bernhardy draws attention to the
traditional weakness of the Romans in it.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Yet considerable
and increasing attention must have been given to it with the
extending operations of the Roman army and the growth of
commerce with distant lands. Maps were in use even in early
times. Varro<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> mentions a ‘picta Italia’ in the temple of Tellus,
and Propertius testifies that he was compelled to learn by heart
the countries of the world painted on the map.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> The elder Pliny<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
mentions Pytheas, the famous Gaul, who lived probably at the
time of Alexander the Great, and was a writer on geography,
‘praesertim Geographiae notitia illustris, commendatus ... ab
omnibus gentibus’.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Aethicus Hister tells us in his <i>Cosmographia</i>
of a measurement of the Roman world which was ordered by
Julius Caesar and carried out by the ablest men of the day, and
there were writers on geography like Poseidonius and Mela.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> In
our period we find the subject being used as part of the imperial
policy. ‘Moreover’, says Eumenius, ‘let the young see in the
porticoes of the new schools all countries and all seas and whatever
of cities or races or tribes the invincible princes either restore or
overcome by their valour or bind down by the fear they inspire.’<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
And again, since children learn better by eye than by ear,<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> ‘the
situation, the extent and the distances of all places have been
marked and the names given, the source and the mouth of every
river, the bend of the coast-lines, the curves of the sea where it
flows round the land or breaks into it.’<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> In Ausonius we are
struck with the accuracy and extent of the author’s geographical
knowledge, due, no doubt, to the fact that he had to practise it
in his school. He refers directly to maps in the <i>Gratiarum
Actio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> He wants to put in a compact form all the emperor’s
praises, as the geographers do with the earth (<i>qui terrarum orbem
unius tabulae ambitu circumscribunt</i>). Such a ‘tabula’ Millin
reports at Autun, on the site of the Maeniana, containing the
outline of Italy with the boundaries of Gaul and towns like
Bononia, Forum Gallorum, Mutina.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>Astronomy, in an elementary way, was quite popular among
the ‘savants’ of Gaul. Ausonius’s grandfather, Arborius, dabbled
in it,<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> and Sidonius mentions it frequently. It was one of the
accomplishments of Claudianus Mamertus that he could wield the
horoscope with Euphrates and explore the stars with Atlas.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
When Sidonius describes Lampridius’s superstition in consulting
astrologers (for superstition was intimately connected with the
few scientific facts of the subject which had been ascertained),
he mentions technical terms such as ‘climactericos’, ‘thema’,
‘diastemata zodiaca’, which indicate an organized body of
astrological tradition, of which Julianus Vertacus and Fullonius
Saturninus were the founders, according to Sidonius (<i>matheseos
peritissimos conditores</i>).<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> He writes to his friend Leontius<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Phoebus, the head of whose college can surpass in argument not
only musicians, but also masters of geometry, arithmetic, and
astrology. For no one knew more accurately than he the
astrological significance of stars and planets in their varying
positions. These references give us some idea of the extent of
astronomical knowledge, which cannot have included much more
than elementary facts about the zodiac, the solstices, the equinoxes,
and the revolution of the planets. The more strictly
astrological developments were, no doubt, confined to such as
cared to make a hobby of them, but some knowledge of the stars
was imparted in the schoolroom and considered necessary to the
pupil for the understanding of poetry,<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> as it was for practical
purposes, by no less an authority than Quintilian. For time was
largely computed by direct reference to the sun and the stars.</p>

<h4>(ii) <span class="smcap">The Substance and Methods of Secondary Education</span></h4>

<p>From the grammarian the boy passed into the hands of the
rhetor and studied ‘Rhetoric’. We must be careful in our
interpretation of this term. Just as ‘Grammatikê’ covered
a large number of subjects, so ‘Rhetorikê’ was not confined to
the theory of speaking. ‘On apprenait des rhéteurs l’art de
bien parler et de bien écrire, non pas seulement sur la littérature
ou la poésie, mais aussi sur l’histoire, la morale, la science même.’<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
The characteristic thing about the rhetor’s school was discussion
and declamation, and the end in view was oratory or oratorical
composition; the characteristic thing about the grammarian’s
school was exposition and interpretation, and the immediate end
in view was encyclopedic knowledge. But the subjects treated
in either case were very much the same; only, the emphasis was
shifted. The grammarian used his knowledge to expand the
text, the rhetor his imagination. The grammarian’s method
was prosaic, the rhetor strove to be poetic.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>The rhetor chose some subject from imagination or from
literature (from the books which the grammarian had been
reading with his class) for his pupils to exercise their ingenuity
upon. Three stages may be distinguished<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> in the schools of the
later Empire. First, the <i>Vergilian stage</i> (<i>locus Vergilianus</i>), at
which the students paraphrased some speech in the <i>Aeneid</i>. The
point was to portray as closely as possible the emotions of the
original speaker. ‘Proponebatur mihi negotium animae meae’
(says Augustine) ‘ut dicerem verba Iunonis irascentis et dolentis
quod non posset Italia Teucrorum avertere regem.’<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Next there
came the <i>Dictiones Ethicae</i>—soliloquies which persons in history
or mythology would have made on certain occasions: e.g. Juno’s
words when she saw Antaeus matched with Hercules, or Thetis
before the body of Achilles. Ennodius gives several examples
of this type: ‘Verba Didonis cum abeuntem videret Aeneam,<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
Verba Menelai cum Troiam videret inustam,’<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> and so forth.
Thirdly, there were the <i>Controversiae</i>, nearer to the oratory of
public life, on some more general subject, e.g. against an ambassador
who betrays his country, against one who refuses to support
an aged father, against a tyrant who has honoured a parricide
with a statue, ‘in eum qui in lupanari statuam Minervae
locavit.’<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>The influence of Vergil did not decline with the entry into
the rhetor’s school. The rhetors of Ausonius’s day could hardly
write a page without a Vergilian reminiscence. And Servius<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
tells us of the rhetors Titianus and Calvus that they chose all
their subjects from Vergil, adapting them for rhetorical exercises.
They gave as examples of the <i>controversia</i> the speeches of Venus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
and Juno in <i>Aeneid</i> x. 17 and x. 63. When Venus says to Juno:
‘A cause of peril hast thou been to these whom Fate has granted
the land of Italy,’ she is using the ‘status absolutivus’. Juno,
in her reply, uses the ‘status relativus’.</p>

<p>This passage gives a single instance of that intricate system
of technical terminology which the study of rhetoric had
elaborated. But in our period there is no writer who explains
that system in any way. It had become traditional, covering
a large space of time; it had become almost universal, covering
a large part of the Roman Empire. The text-books we hear of
belong to a previous time: Cicero’s <i>Rhetorica</i>, the anonymous
<i>Rhetoricorum ad Herennium libri quattuor</i>, and Quintilian.
The work of C. Chirius Fortunatianus,<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> it is true, dates from
the fifth century, and that of Sulpicius Victor<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> from the fourth.
But Fortunatianus drew mainly from Quintilian and Cicero, and
Sulpicius Victor, in the fragments of his book that survive,
professes his dependence on the traditional statement of the
subject. ‘I have set in order’, he says, ‘the general rhetorical
principles that have come down to us, and have been taught me
by my masters. Yet I have reserved the right to pass over
points as I thought fit, adhering in the main to the traditional
substance and order, and inserting from other authors a number
of points which I considered necessary.’<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> In fact, all the fourth-
and fifth-century writers on rhetoric (in that age of summaries)
are merely compilers or epitomizers. Solid and persistent is the
body of tradition which runs through the centuries. The precepts
and examples<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> which we find in Seneca, the rhetorician,
are almost identical with those of Ennodius at the end of the
fifth century; and Quintilian is found again in Hilary of
Poitiers.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it need not distress us that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
contemporary account of the activities of the rhetor’s school.
We do not even possess the title of a declamation at Bordeaux,
and the very silence is significant: the rhetorical system was
too widespread and too well known to need special mention
or explanation. Not only the Latin rhetoricians were bound
together by this common tradition: the Greek of the East
shared in it as well. Libanius is on familiar terms with
Symmachus,<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> who loved pagan oratory next to pagan religion,
and mentions the books of Favorinus who was a native of Arles,
and lived in the time of Hadrian.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> One of the Theodori to
whom Libanius wrote, was, according to Ammianus, a Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
and so was Rufinus, the ‘Praefectus praetorio’, of whose praises
the letters are full. Intercourse between East and West was
free and frequent. But the most convincing proof of the unity
of the tradition is found in a comparison of the Greek rhetoricians
with men like Quintilian or Seneca: there is hardly any difference
of importance.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> But the <i>Rhetores Graeci</i> give us a much more
detailed and lively picture of means and methods than any other
body of evidence.</p>

<p>In imparting his facts the grammarian had to work up to
that educational consummation represented by the rhetorical
school. ‘Ratio dicendi’ is quite distinctly laid down by Quintilian
as one of his duties.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> In giving his exercises, therefore,
he would endeavour to give such information on technical and
traditional points as would prepare the pupil for his course of
study in the senior school. Sometimes the pupil went for further
preparation to a special master.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Sometimes a whole course—the
famous ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία—in which special stress was laid
on music and geometry<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>—was put in between the grammarian’s
and the rhetor’s schools. How far these practices were customary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
in Gaul we have no means of ascertaining; but it is certain
that there must have been exercises preparatory to the rhetorical
training, and it is these which are recorded by the Greek
rhetoricians, and which give us a unique insight into the
methods of that training. Προγυμνάσματα they are called
by the rhetors, and defined by one of them as ἂ πρὸ τῆς
ὑποθέσεως (i.e. before declaiming from a given subject)
ἀναγκαῖόν ἐστι εἰδέναι τε καὶ ἐπιεικῶς ἐγγυμνάζεσθαι.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>Aphthonius was a sophist of Antioch, a pupil of the great
Libanius, and flourished during the second half of the fourth
century. He is mentioned by Libanius<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> as a teacher of boys.
Of his many works we possess only the <i>Progymnasmata</i> and the
<i>Fables</i>. Closely associated with his name are those of Theon
and Hermogenes. Hoppichler has demonstrated<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> how similar
their works are. Theon is clearly the oldest,<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> and Aphthonius is
younger than Hermogenes.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> From a scholiast who says that after
Aphthonius had published his work, that of Hermogenes came
to be looked on as ἀσαφῆ πως καὶ δύσληπτα, it is equally clear
that Aphthonius was the most recent of these writers. That he
was also the best and most enduring is shown by the many
commentaries and scholia on his work (which is often verbally
quoted by later rhetoricians like Nicolaus), and by the fact that
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries his book was still
used in schools and universities. Indeed, the form of school
exercise which he suggests persists up to the present day.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>Aphthonius, then, may be taken as the best representative of
the rhetorical school at Antioch.</p>

<p>His first chapter<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> deals with fables. They are widely and
frequently used by teachers to point a lesson (ἐκ παραινέσεως),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
e.g. the story of the ants and the cicadas. He proceeds to
expound the treatment of the subject, and deals first with
narration (διήγημα), of which there are three kinds: (1) <i>poetic</i>
(δραματικόν), which has to do with fictitious subjects; (2) <i>historic</i>,
which has to do with the past; and (3) <i>civil</i>, dealing with controversial
cases. In every narration, again, there are six elements:
agent, act, time, place, manner, cause; and the four virtues of
narration are: clearness, brevity, probability (πιθανότης), and
purity of language (ἑλληνισμός). The example given, telling
why the rose is red, has at least the virtues of brevity and clearness.
It may be noticed that Quintilian assigns <i>narrationes
poeticas</i> to the grammarian and <i>narrationes historicas</i> to the
rhetor.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>Of the collection of fables made by Aphthonius some were
apparently written by himself. These are rather less pointed
than those of Aesop, and more directly applied to school conditions.
Such is the story of the goose and the swan.</p>

<p>‘A rich man kept a goose and a swan, but not for the same
purpose: for the former he kept for his table, and the latter for
the sake of its singing. When the time came for the goose to
be killed (which was his proper end), the man, not being able
to distinguish the one from the other in the darkness of night,
took the swan instead of the goose: but by singing the swan
showed his nature, whereupon by the sweetness of his song he
escaped death.’</p>

<p>The general moral is that music provides respite from death,
and the particular application, that boys should love eloquence.
Similarly, in the story of the provident ant it is pointed out that
laziness in youth means distress in old age (οὕτως νεότης πονεῖν
οὐκ ἐθέλονσα, παρὰ τὸ γῆρας κακοπραγεῖ).</p>

<p>Some very familiar fables are included in Aphthonius’s collection:
the crow and the cheese, the ass and the lion’s skin, the
sick lion, &amp;c. These were taken over from Aesop and are found,
polished and versified, in Avienus.</p>

<p>Aphthonius next defines the Chreia as a pointed saying,
applied to some person or thing. It is so called because it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
‘useful’ for moral and intellectual lessons. There are three
general classes: (1) the <i>Word-Chreia</i>, found only in speech; (2)
the <i>Act-Chreia</i> (e.g. Pythagoras, on being asked how long a
man’s life was, answered by appearing for a short time and then
disappearing. A scholiast adds the example of Tarquin and the
poppies); (3) the <i>Mixed Chreia</i>. The divisions of every Chreia
are: (1) <i>praise</i>, (2) <i>paraphrase</i>, (3) <i>cause</i>, (4) <i>the contrary</i> (i.e.
the pupil states what would happen if the opposite were true),
(5) <i>simile</i> (the same sort of thing in other spheres), (6) <i>example</i>
(instances of the same thing in recorded history—generally in
the poets), (7) <i>testimony of the ancients</i> (appeal to similar teaching
in older writers like Hesiod), (8) <i>short epilogue</i> (a summary of the
argument). Then follows an example of the Word-Chreia,
illustrating all the divisions. The saying of Isocrates that the
roots of education are bitter, but its fruits sweet, is worked up
into a little essay. The mediaeval scholiasts go copiously into
all the minor points raised by the various Chreiae, and give
biblical examples from Genesis and Ecclesiastes in which Juvenal,
Hesiod, and Menander curiously intermingle.</p>

<p>Next comes Sententia (γνώμη), an aphoristic saying of a hortatory
or enunciatory kind. Unlike the Chreia, it is found only in
speech. Examples are:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">εἷς οἰωνὸσ ἄριστος ἀμύνεσθαι περὶ πάτρης</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Dulce et decorum est ...)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">οὐδὲν ἀκιδνότερον γαῖα τρέφει ἀνθρώποιο.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Of all things Man most wretched is on earth.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There are three kinds: hortatory (προτρεπτικόν), dehortatory
(ἀποτρεπτικόν), enunciatory (ἀποφαντικόν). Further divisions
are: simple and composite, or probable, true, and hyperbolical.
All of these are amply illustrated. The same divisions hold as
for the Chreia, and they are exemplified by developing the
protreptic gnomê that death is better than poverty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">χρὴ πενίην φεύγοντα καὶ ἐς μεγακήτεα πόντον</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ῥίπτειν καὶ πετρῶν, Κύρνε, κατ’ ἠλιβάτων.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There follows a chapter on Refutation (ἀνασκευή). The first
step is to attack your opponent (τὴν τῶν φησάντων διαβολήν),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the next, to give a statement of his case (πράγματος ἔκθεσιν),
the third, to refute this statement under the following heads:
(1) Obscurity, (2) Incredibility, (3) Impossibility, (4) Illogicality,
(5) Impropriety, (6) Inexpediency. Take, for example, the
statements of the poets about Daphne. In his διαβολή the
student says that it is needless to convict the poets of folly: they
stand discredited by what they say about the gods. He then
briefly narrates the story of Phoebus and Daphne, and is ready
for the refutation. Under the heads of <i>Obscurity</i> and <i>Improbability</i>,
the difficulties of Daphne’s birth from Ladon and Terra are
discussed in a forced and perverse way. ‘If a human being is
born from a river, why not a river from a human being?’
‘What name are we going to give to a union of a river and
Earth? In the case of men it is called “marriage”, but Earth
is not a human being’, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Under the head of the <i>Impossible</i>, he contends: ‘But granted
that Daphne was the daughter of Terra and Ladon—who brought
her up? That’s a poser! If you say her father, well, human
beings just <i>don’t</i> live in rivers: he would unwittingly have
drowned her. If you say her mother, it means that she lived
under the earth: therefore, her charms would be hidden, and she
would have no admirers.’</p>

<p>There is also the head of <i>Impropriety</i>. Granted even that she
could have been brought up, it is absurd to attribute love to
a god: ἔρως τῶν ὄντων τὸ χαλεπώτατον (a moral note for the
boy’s benefit). It is wrong to connect such terrible things (τὰ
δεινότατα) with the gods.</p>

<p><i>Illogicality.</i> How could a girl beat Phoebus in the race?
Men are better than women, and <i>a fortiori</i> gods must surpass
them. Why did her mother help her? Surely she could not
have feared a ‘mésalliance’! Either, therefore, she was not her
mother, or else she was a bad mother.</p>

<p><i>Inexpediency.</i> There is no point in Earth taking away her
daughter and offending Phoebus, and then giving him the laurel
with which he crowns his tripods. Nature has separated the
human and the divine: it’s no good having a god matched with
a mortal maid.</p>

<p><i>Peroration.</i> All poets are fools; avoid them. But we must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
stop talking about poets, lest like them we talk nonsense (πέρας
ἔστω τῶν ποιητῶν, μὴ κατὰ ποιητὰς δόξω φθέγγεσθαι).</p>

<p><i>Confirmation</i> (κατασκευή) is the next subject. The method is
to praise the man who makes the statement which is to be confirmed,
to state the case to be established, and to ‘confirm’ it
under the following heads: (the opposites of those mentioned
under Refutation) the manifest, the probable, the possible, the
logical, the proper, the expedient. Taking the same thesis, the
credibility of Daphne’s story, he attempts to prove, with considerable
ingenuity, the opposite conclusion: ἐπὶ τούτοις
θαυμάζω τοὺς ποιητὰς καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τὸ μέτρον (the poem) τιμῶ.</p>

<p>Again, there is the <i>locus communis</i> (κοινὸς τόπος), a speech
which emphasizes the good or evil in a person or thing, and
which is so generalized that it can be applied to all persons or
things of that class or in those circumstances. Thus a <i>locus
communis</i> about traitors would fit all who do treacherous deeds.
It has the following divisions:</p>

<p>(1) By the contrary (ἐκ τοῦ ἐναντίου). (2) Exposition of the
subject. (3) Comparison—which shows the person denounced
to be worse than others, or the person praised, better. (4)
Opinion (γνώμη)—denouncing or praising the intention of the
agent. (5) Digression—conjecturally (στοχαστικῶς)—reviling
the past life of the man. (6) Exclusion of pity. (7) Finally,
the following heads: the legitimate, the just, the expedient, the
possible, the honourable, and the conclusion from the results
obtained. A conclusion on the well-worn subject of tyrants is,
that after all a democratic jury is all that is needed to destroy
their power.</p>

<p>The subject of Praise (ἐγκώμιον) is next treated. Praise is of
persons or of things, and a list of praiseworthy subjects is given.
It may be applied to one of these subjects as a group, e.g. the
Athenians, or individually, e.g. one particular Athenian. The
divisions given for the praise of a person are:</p>

<p>(1) Prooimion. Quality of subject to be praised.</p>

<p>(2) Class to which subject belongs: race, country, ancestors,
parents.</p>

<p>(3) Education of subject: training, art and laws of his environment
and education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>(4) Achievements (main division):</p>

<p class="in2">(<i>a</i>) Qualities of soul: courage, prudence, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="in2">(<i>b</i>) Qualities of body: beauty, strength, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="in2">(<i>c</i>) Qualities of fortune: rank, friends, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(5) Comparison—to the advantage of the subject.</p>

<p>(6) Epilogue, in the nature of a prayer.</p>

<p>These heads are illustrated in panegyrics on Thucydides,
and on an abstract thing like wisdom, where the divisions are
naturally modified and curtailed.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the chapter on Praise is that on Censure
or Vituperation (ψόγος), which starts with a bad quality and
expands it. It does not raise moral issues or propose penalties
(differing herein from a <i>locus communis</i>), but merely attacks
(μόνην ἔχειν διαβολήν). An example, with the same divisions
as in the previous chapter, is given of a vituperation of Philip
of Macedon. Here, as in the case of praise, there is a mass of
illustrations by the mediaeval scholiasts.</p>

<p><i>Comparison</i> (σύγκρισις) of persons or things admits of ψόγος
or ἐγκώμιον or both. Large wholes should not be compared, but
rather similar parts, e.g. one head with another. The divisions,
which are the same as in the previous chapters, are illustrated by
a comparison of Hector and Achilles, to the advantage, naturally,
of the latter.</p>

<p>The characterization of a person, by putting a speech into his
mouth (ἠθοποιία), was another department of exercise. It is
defined as μίμησις ἤθους ὑποκειμένου προσώπου. Three types
are given, not very clearly distinguished from one another:</p>

<p class="hanging">Εἰδωλοποιία—when a well-known character no longer living
is made to speak, as in the Δῆμοι of Eupolis. (Apparently
only local or political people are meant.)</p>

<p class="hanging">Προσωποποιία—when both words and speaker are imagined.</p>

<p class="hanging">Ἠθοποιία proper—when the person is known from literature,
and words are put into his mouth to illustrate his
character.</p>

<p>The classes of Ethopoeia proper may be described as:</p>

<p><i>Emotional</i> (παθητικαί), e.g. the words Hecuba would have
uttered on the fall of Troy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>‘<i>Ethical</i>’ (ἠθικαί), e.g. what a man who had never seen the sea
would say on beholding the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><i>Mixed</i>, e.g. what Achilles would have said over the body of
Patroclus. The style is to be clear, and the sentences short,
‘flowery’ (ἀνθηρῷ),<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> antithetical, without adornment or involved
figures. An example of Emotional Ethopoeia, illustrating the
divisions past, present, and future, is given by a speech put into
Niobe’s mouth on the death of her children.</p>

<p>Next comes <i>Description</i> (ἔκφρασις) of persons or things. Descriptive
extracts from Homer and Thucydides are given, with the
general counsel that the describer must adapt himself to his
subject in every way. Only two classes are suggested: <i>simple</i>
(descriptions of actions) and <i>complex</i> (descriptions of action and
place). The citadel of Alexandria is the stock example.</p>

<p>By ‘<i>Thesis</i>’ Aphthonius means the study of a question in the
course of a speech. There are two kinds: (1) ‘<i>civil</i>’, e.g. must
one marry? and (2) <i>contemplative</i>, e.g. are there more worlds
than one? The divisions are: ἔφοδος or <i>prooemium</i>, and the
heads: the legitimate, the just, the expedient, the possible. The
example given (εἰ γαμητέον) is interspersed with the objector’s
remarks (ἀντιθέσεις) and the replies of the speaker (λύσεις).</p>

<p>Some grammarians consider the method of supporting or
opposing a law (συνηγορία and κατηγορία) a subject for a
school exercise. After the prooemium comes a consideration of
objections (τὸ ἐναντίον) and the treatment of the subject takes
the same form as in the preceding chapter. Again we have the
alternation of ἀντιθέσεις and λύσεις.</p>

<p>Such is the course of exercises by which the adolescent boy
was prepared for the speeches of the rhetor’s school, and of public
life; and from them we gather a fairly definite impression of
the main activities that succeeded those of the grammarian.</p>

<p>These activities were eked out by several ‘senior’ studies,
which must be briefly considered. It has been disputed that
there were any subjects in the rhetor’s school at all except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
rhetoric.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Now it is true that Gratian’s famous decree about
teachers in 376 does not specially mention philosophers, and that
there is very little official recognition of them, though we are
told that Antoninus Pius gave salaries to rhetors and to philosophers
‘<i>per omnes provincias</i>’.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> But whether in our period philosophy
was an organized subject or not, there can be no doubt that it
had its place in the schools.</p>

<p>In the grammarian’s school it was touched on in a superficial
way: Paulinus of Pella talks of learning ‘dogmata Socratus’ at
the tender age of five.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> But there could have been no serious
appreciation of the content of philosophy before the pupil had
reached the rhetor’s school. Ausonius mentions ‘dogma Platonicum<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>’
as one of the avenues by which a Bordeaux professor
reached renown, and Nepotianus<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> is ‘disputator ad Cleanthen
Stoicum’. That there was some sort of philosophic discussion
we gather from the <i>Eclogues</i>, though, no doubt, it was mainly
rhetorical. Speaking of the ΝΑΙ ΚΑΙ ΟΥ ΠΥΘΑΓΟΡΙΚΟΝ
Ausonius says that these two words (Yes and No) form the basis
of philosophic discussion. ‘Starting from them, the school also,
in harmony with its gentle training, gently debates philosophic
questions, and with them as a basis the whole tribe of logicians
holds debate’.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>It is clear from Sidonius that the subject was popular among
the ‘litterati’ of fifth-century Gaul. Logic is often mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
and the description of the ‘septem sapientes’ shows a comprehensive
knowledge of the history of philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Eusebius,<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
a professor of philosophy at Lyons, gathered around him a number
of students who were eager to discuss problems. The <i>Categories</i>
of Aristotle are especially mentioned as subjects of study. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
philosopher was the president of the company, holding a sort of
‘seminar’, in which he appointed a spokesman and discussed
points with each in turn. He was very learned, and ‘was as
pleased as could be when some very obscure and involved problems
happened to arise, so that he could scatter abroad the treasures
of his learning’.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Plato dominated contemporary thought.
There was a Platonic club, ‘collegium conplatonicorum’.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Faustus
(Sidonius tells him) has married a fair woman and borne
her off with strong passion, and her name is Philosophia. She
has abjured worldly wisdom and belongs to the Church of Christ,
but none the less, also, to the Academy of Plato.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> ‘On voit que
les Gallo-Romains du cinquième siècle,’ says Fauriel, ‘cultivaient
avec ardeur une certaine philosophie qu’ils prenaient pour celle de
Platon.’<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>There was a tendency to give a wide and vague meaning to
the word ‘philosophy’. For its proper study, knowledge of the
sciences was postulated. Music and astrology are spoken of by
Sidonius as ‘consequentia membra philosophiae’.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> So in the
fourth century philosophy ‘was regarded as incomplete unless it
included some knowledge of natural phenomena to be used for
purposes of analogy’.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Hilary of Poitiers, for example, in the <i>De
Trinitate</i> and the Commentaries, refers to facts of animal birth,
life and death; to medicine and surgery; to the natural history
of trees and animals; and we know of a lost work of his against
the physician Dioscorus which may have been a refutation of
materialistic arguments.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>When we attempt to look at the purely pagan side of philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
in this period, the impression made by the scanty data is not one
of greatness. Agricola, indeed, in a previous century, could say
of his Gallic studies ‘se prima in iuventa studium philosophiae
acrius, ultra quam concessum Romano ac senatori, hausisse’,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> but
he had been at Massilia, which was different from the rest by
reason of its Greek spirit. And his very words indicate the
general Roman attitude to philosophy, the inflexibility of a
positive and practical mind which resulted in a superficial conception
of the subject. To a certain extent it seems reasonable
to say that the provinces accepted this attitude as part of the
Roman tradition. The Gaul of the fourth century certainly
seems to have done so. For Ausonius, though he makes a fine
show of technical terms and learned allusions, is far from suggesting
any depth of thought. We instinctively agree with a
commentator<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> who regards him as ‘tritis et vulgivagis sententiis
ex usu scholastico ditatus’. His philosophical verses<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> in the
<i>Eclogues</i> are translations and only the first part strikes a deeper
moral note; the rest, like the ΝΑΙ ΚΑΙ ΟΥ ΠΥΘΑΓΟΡΙΚΟΝ,
is all more or less trifling. It is significant that he calls himself
a Christian, yet he gives no sign of Christian thought, and
shrugs his shoulders about the question of immortality. Again
and again he dismisses the matter with a query.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Even Sidonius,
who is a semi-Christian and touched to some extent by the
impetus which Christianity was at that time giving to thought,
is diffident about independent thinking and fearful lest the
Roman tradition<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> should be impaired, especially by a provincial.
He uses the technical terms which Cicero had introduced from
the Greek.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>Jung thinks that the comparative neglect of philosophy was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
part of a definite imperial policy, which remembered the fact
that the stirring teaching of the Druids (<i>actuosa doctrina</i>), regarding
the immortality of the soul, urged the Gauls to warfare and
made them reckless in rebellion.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> But this appears to be founded
rather on the fancifulness of an exaggerated nationalism than on
a general consideration of existing conditions. For slackness of
thought and lack of thinkers was a common characteristic of the
time, and it had its roots in the general paralysis produced by
the imperial system and the rhetorical form of education (factors
which will be more fully considered at a later stage), rather than
in a measure aimed at philosophy for so special and so antiquated
a reason.</p>

<p>The contention that there were none except teachers of
Rhetoric in the secondary schools of Gaul, seems to rest on better
evidence in the case of Law. In spite of Juvenal’s well-known
allusion to Gaul as a school of forensic eloquence<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> and his contention:
‘Gallia causidicos docuit facunda Britannos’, and
Lucian’s reference<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> to the famous lawyers of Massilia, Menecrates,
Charmolus, and Zenothemis, Ausonius mentions no
professors of law, though there are those among the Bordeaux
teachers whom ‘forum ... fecit nobiles’.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> The studious
Victorius investigates ‘ius pontificum’, the resolutions of the
people and the Senate, and the codes of Draco and Solon, but only
as the grammarian would and from the antiquarian point of view.
It is worm-eaten and ancient manuscripts that he studies rather
than more obvious and accessible works.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>In the fifth century there are indications of considerable
interest. And this is what we should expect. For the publication
of the Theodosian Code in 438 made the study of law more
accessible, and tended to eliminate the superstitious and the
sacramental element in it. So Fauriel says that jurisprudence
attracted more men of distinction then than in previous centuries.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
Sidonius mentions particularly the learned Leo of Narbonne who
was more learned in the Twelve Tables than Appius Claudius
himself,<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> and he calls Marcellinus ‘skilled in laws’.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>Arles, the seat of the prefect of the Gauls and of the emperor,
naturally became a centre for the study of Roman law. It was
there that Petronius<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> practised his profession.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that while the Gauls were famed for
legal knowledge and ability, Rome was still regarded as the
school of jurisprudence. It is not mere rhetoric when Symmachus
calls Rome ‘Latiaris facundiae domicilium’,<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> and Sidonius
‘Domicilium legum’.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Rutilius extols Rome with unaffected
enthusiasm for her law: ‘Thou hast also embraced the world
with thy law-bringing triumphs and makest all to live by a
common bond.’<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>The belief in Rome’s eternal sway<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> is for him connected
chiefly with her law. ‘Stretch forth thy laws that are destined
to live into the Roman ages, and do thou alone unafraid regard
the distaff of the Fates,’<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> and poetic vision is aided by the
lawyer’s foresight.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> He tells of a Gaul, Palladius, who went to
study law at Rome:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Facundus iuvenis Gallorum nuper ab arvis</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">missus Romani discere iura fori.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And we are told that St. Germanus who, according to the life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
claimed to be by his pupil Constantius, was born at Auxerre
towards the end of the fourth century, had a similar training.
To set the crown upon his literary education in Gaul he went to
study law at Rome.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Rome, in fact, maintained her supremacy
in this branch longer than in any other, and her professors
attracted students from all parts of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>The connexion between jurisprudence and imperial matters is
clear. For a study of Rome’s great contribution to the world
could not but stimulate admiration for the imperial city. By
examining the law, the provincial realized more clearly the
advantage of the <i>pax Romana</i>. One of the panegyrists<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> declared
to Maximian in 293 ‘iustitia cognitione iuris addiscitur’,<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> and it
is clear that his appreciation of the moral benefits of Roman
order is more than mere rhetoric. Perhaps Rome’s rulers perceived
this, and made it their policy (as Jung<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> suggests) to
attract students of law to Rome, that they might see things
from Rome’s point of view, and facilitate the government of the
provinces by applying the law according to the Roman tradition.
For as the Empire had grown and its administration increased,
there had arisen a need for officials who would carry out the law
with ability and uniformity; and complete uniformity could
only be attained by a knowledge of law seen as the Roman
saw it.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>Justinian, in the preface to the <i>Digest</i> which he addresses to
the teachers of law in the Empire, reviews the study of jurisprudence
in the past. It was hopelessly deficient. Only six
books were studied and those intricate, confused, and partly
obsolete (<i>iura utilia in se perraro habentes</i>). Among the six books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
were the <i>Institutes</i> of Gaius, but they were not consecutively
studied, many parts being omitted as superfluous. The teaching,
in fact, was entirely haphazard; Gaius was given to the first-year
students, ‘passim et quasi per saturam collectum et utile
cum inutilibus mixtum’. Only in their second year did they
learn the first part of the <i>Institutes</i>, and it was an unheard of
thing to go into details. They also learnt certain ‘tituli’, and
more of these in their third year, when they were initiated into
the ‘responsa’ of the great Papinianus (<i>ad sublimissimum Papinianum
eiusque responsa iter eis aperiebatur</i>). But here, too, their
training was imperfect, as they only read eight books. The
students read the ‘Pauliana responsa’ for themselves in a slipshod
fashion (<i>per imperfectum, et iam quodammodo male consuetum inconsequentiae
cursum</i>). This was the end of their theoretical training
throughout ancient times. Justinian is resolved that there shall
be an improvement and proceeds to outline a scheme by which
the youth of the future may be better instructed. This syllabus,
however, lies beyond the limits of our period.</p>

<p>The emperor is at pains to kindle enthusiasm for jurisprudence.
He exhorts the students to exert all diligence, so that on the
completion of their studies the glorious hope of governing the
Empire may be theirs.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> For, as Gibbon remarks, ‘all the civil
magistrates were drawn from the profession of the law.’<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> <i>Antecessores</i><a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
or lecturing lawyers were appointed throughout the
Empire, and the places where they taught were called ‘stationes’.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
The course, at any rate in the time of Justinian, lasted five years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
(<i>Constitution</i>, ‘Omnem Reipublicae’, § 5). Learned lawyers like
Antistius Labeo under Augustus lectured for six months and
devoted six months to writing.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> When the students dispersed
themselves through the provinces there was no lack of opportunity
to practise their profession. The court of the Praetorian
prefect of the East alone required the services of one hundred and
fifty advocates,<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> and the rewards so liberally promised by Justinian
for the ‘laudabile vitaeque hominum necessarium advocationis
officium’<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> must have created a vast interest in the study of law.</p>

<p>Whether it was the fault of the teachers or of the pupils or of
the social conditions, it is clear that lawyers had a bad name in
the fourth as well as in the fifth century. The vivid and caustic
description of Ammianus is well known.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> He is suspicious of
legal cunning and has the soldier’s impatience of rhetoric. We
must therefore allow something for his prejudices. But his
analysis cannot be wholly false. We may discount his language
when he describes the profession as consisting of ‘violenta et
rapacissima genera hominum’, but when he enumerates these
classes and gives each its special characteristics, we feel that he
may exaggerate but that he does not invent. The first class
consists of mischief-makers and robbers, ‘odia struentes infesta’.
Their oratory is empty and artificial: ‘eloquentiam inanis quaedam
imitatur fluentia loquendi’. The second class consists of
fraudulent people who make a superstition and a mystery of the
law, increasing its entanglements, ‘velut fata natalicia praemonstrantes’,
in order to enhance their own importance. Thirdly,
there are the unscrupulous advocates who are always ready to
sacrifice truth to money or fame. Finally, we have ‘a shameless
race, perverse and ignorant—men who, having run away from
school too young, scurry about in the nooks and corners of
various states’.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Cicero is the ideal—‘excellentissimus omnium
Cicero’—and Ammianus regards the practice of his day as erring
from the good of the past.</p>

<p>Confirmation of the point in this criticism which most nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
touches education comes from an unexpected source. Sidonius,
the rhetorical, the obscure, the vendor of subtle argument, associates
‘obscurity’ with the lawyers as a special characteristic.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
Nor does he seem to think them particularly helpful. He sends
a man, who has a case about a will, to Bishop Leontius, and begs
him to see that justice is done, using his episcopal authority, if
the lawyers will not help the client.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>Finally, there is medicine. When Denk maintains<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> that
there was no faculty of medicine in the provinces, he cannot
mean to exclude medical study as a subject of secondary education.
There was probably no separate school of medicine,<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> but
Ausonius definitely mentions the ‘medica ars’ as one of the
Bordeaux professors’ titles to fame.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> In former days Massilia
had given to Gaul the medical tradition of the Greeks, just as
Greece had given it to Rome. A certain Crinas, who lived in
the reign of Nero, is said (though apparently only by Bulaeus) to
have been the first to advance the study of medicine at Massilia,
and we gather from Pliny that he introduced astrology into his
medicine and gained an immense name and fortune.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Galen
twice mentions Claudius Abascantus<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> of Lyons, who probably
flourished under Augustus, as a doctor of prominence, and Eutropius
of Bordeaux appears among the writers on medicine in the
fourth century.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Julius Ausonius, the father of the poet, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the court physician of Valentinian I. At the beginning of the
fifth century we find Marcellus Empiricus<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> of Bordeaux composing
a book of prescriptions, ‘compositiones medicamentorum’.
He gives many Celtic plant-names, Druidical beliefs, and a large
number of ἅπαξ εἰρημένα and provincialisms.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> As in the case of
astrology, superstition plays a large part: certain herbs are to
be picked with the left hand, or while muttering some magic
formula like ‘rica, rica, soro’.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> It is partly for this reason that
Ausonius refers to the ‘libros medicinae’ as books closed to the
vulgar, and that his eccentric aunt took up the study of medicine.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
There seems to have been no organized system of medical study,
and we do not even possess any details of the procedure in
a particular case. It seems reasonable to suppose that the
practical part of the profession was acquired by apprenticeship,
while the rhetor confronted the student with such parts of the
medical theory as could be found in the writings of Galen (who
was the central authority) and his successors.</p>

<p>The frequent grouping of the doctors with the teachers in the
Theodosian Code suggests that the public State-paid physicians
taught as well as practised their art. Reinach<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> warns against
certainty on this point, but it is at least probable. The wording
of Constantine’s law<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> of September 27, 333, confirms the supposition.
Doctors and teachers are proclaimed exempt from military
service and public burdens so that they may have leisure to train
others in their art—‘quo facilius studiis liberalibus et memoratis
artibus multos instituant’. Of the original five classes of <i>archiatri</i>
paid by the State—those of the court, those belonging to the
municipalities, the heads of the medicine guilds, those in charge
of the public gymnasia, and those who attended the Vestals—it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
was probably the second, the municipal doctors, who were the
teachers of their profession.</p>

<p>If this is so, it proves that Rome was not the only place where
doctors could be trained, as Denk seems to think.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Indeed, the
provinces were more interested in medicine than Rome herself.
Pliny<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> said in a broad and general way that for six hundred
years Rome had got on without doctors, and it is well known
that the Roman doctors made no important contribution to the
science. Egyptians, Greeks, Gauls—these were the physicians
of Rome. Pliny writes to Trajan asking him to give the citizenship
to a doctor from whom he had derived benefit: ‘est enim
peregrinae condicionis, manumissus a peregrina’.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The doctor
who attends Hadrian on his death-bed is a foreigner.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Ammianus
describes the growing fame of the Alexandrian school of
medicine during the fourth century, as such, that a man, even if
his actual work turned out badly, need only say that he had been
trained at Alexandria in order to gain commendation.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>Then, as now, it was a lucrative profession, according to the
proverb ‘Galenus dat opes’;<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> nor did the benefit to the sick
always correspond to the doctor’s gain.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>A word may perhaps be added on the <i>agrimensores</i>, who represent
the department of science among the Romans that was most
scientifically employed, though all their mathematics came from
Hiero of Alexandria.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Their work was partly military (the
marking out of camps and locating of positions for the army)
and partly civil (the surveying of colonies and provinces for
revenue purposes). In cases of ‘controversia de loco’, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Theodosian Code appoints them judges.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> At first they were free
to practise where and when they could, but in our period they
were attached to guilds, and stood under a ‘primicerius mensorum’.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
This organization of the ‘agrimensores’ implies a certain
amount of training and a professional test of proficiency.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>Their connexion with Gaul is not very clearly attested, but
can hardly be doubted. Frontinus in his <i>De Controversiis Agrorum</i>,
speaking of the well-known question as to the ownership of
the old bed of a river which has flowed out of its course into
another man’s land, says ‘Hae quaestiones maxime in Gallia
togata moventur’.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Again, in speaking of certain technical
surveyor’s terms, he says ‘Hae vocabula in lege quae est in
agro Uritano, in Gallia ... adhuc permanere dicuntur’,<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> which
shows that surveying had long been connected with Cisalpine
Gaul. In view of the laws of the Theodosian Code of our period
about surveyors, it seems possible that in Transalpine Gaul there
may have been schools for the training of <i>agrimensores</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A question that comes into one’s mind on reading Ausonius is
whether, in the methods of the Gallic master, mnemonics did
not play an important part.</p>

<p>We find in the <i>Eclogues</i> verses which, on the face of them,
suggest special composition for school use. The ‘Monosticha de
Mensibus’<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> inevitably remind one of school rhymes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Primus Romanas ordiris, Iane, Kalendas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Februa vicino mense Numa instituit, &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So the verses giving the number of days in each month<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
(‘Thirty days hath September’), or the days on which the Nones
and the Ides fall in the various months,<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> or the intervals between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the Ides of the one month and the Kalends of the next,<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> or the
order of the seasons,<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> or the names and places of the Greek
games,<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> or the labours of Hercules,<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> all suggest a similar
purpose.</p>

<p>Again, in his metrical summary of the Caesars of Suetonius,
written for his son, we find ‘monosticha de ordine imperatorum’,<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
‘de aetate imperii eorum monosticha’,<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> ‘de obitu singulorum
monosticha’,<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> all of which look very much like mnemonics.</p>

<p>First of all, their style is such as is suitable to school children—simple,
clear, and terse, and the absence of rhetoric and affectation
is not less striking than the dullness of the lines.</p>

<p>Secondly, it was a tradition handed down by the last great
writer on education, that the memory should be trained by
various devices. And the fourth century was prone to be tradition-bound.</p>

<p>Cicero says that Simonides of Ceos was the founder of the ‘ars
memoriae’,<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> i.e. the ‘techne’, the system for developing the
memory, a statement which Quintilian repeats before expounding
his views on the subject. This he does with care, feeling the
importance of memory—as ‘thesaurus eloquentiae’.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Only the
man who remembers well, he says, in effect (and his words have
a modern ring), can ever hope to become an orator.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> There was
always a tendency among the Romans towards encyclopaedic
learning, which was the main feature of the grammarian’s
school. We notice it also in the ostentatious lists of authors
given by Sidonius.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>Nor can we wonder at this. The whole educational system
was calculated to produce a good memory. The grammarian’s
school supplied facts which had to be remembered in declamations,
and the rhetor introduced a host of technicalities which had also
to be kept in memory. The declaimer had to fit into his speech
as many quotations as he could possibly remember,<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
Ausonius’s letter to his grandson the ‘good boy’ is the one with
the long memory.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, Quintilian recommended that boys
should learn as much as possible by heart, going over the same
ground again and again (<i>quasi eundem cibum remandendi</i>, <i>sc.</i> <i>opus</i>).
They must, therefore, begin with the poets, before going on to
prose which is harder to remember.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Memory is a matter of
pigeon-holes. What is to be remembered must be imagined in
certain places, so that the order of the places will recall the order
of the things to be remembered. We shall then use the ‘places’
instead of tablets, and the images associated with them as letters
(<i>ut locis pro cera, simulacris pro litteris uteremur</i>).<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> To cultivate
the memory various tricks may be tried. We learn a large
subject by remembering parts of it in order; or we may take a
sign to stand for the thing to be remembered, e.g. an anchor for
‘sailing’, or a weapon for ‘campaign’. Like Cicero, he lays
stress on ‘loca’, imagined or actual, and on ‘simulacra vel
imagines’. In the case of a long speech it is best to divide it
into parts which should not be too small. Division is important.
‘Qui recte diviserit, nunquam poterit in rerum ordine errare.’
He also recommends marking a difficult passage (<i>aliquas apponere
notas</i>).<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, we may note the fruits of this training, as far as
memory is concerned. Ausonius, by writing the <i>Cento Nuptialis</i>,
proved only one good thing: that he knew the whole of
Vergil by heart. Minervius<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> was noted for his memory. Ausonius
spends ten lines in describing it, and clearly indicates how
highly it was prized. Nepotianus, too, is specially commended
for possessing this gift.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>In view of all this, we may not unfairly conclude that
mnemonics played a considerable part in the schools of Gaul.
In the history of the human race, as in that of the individual,<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the memorizing stage comes before the development of thought.
And the less advanced systems of education all over the world
are characterized by their almost exclusive emphasis on learning
things by heart.</p>

<h4>(iii) <span class="smcap">Control and Arrangement of the School</span></h4>

<h5>(a) <i>Discipline in primary and secondary schools.</i></h5>

<p>The rhetorical tradition brought with it certain traditional
methods, and one of them was the excessive use of corporal
punishment. In the East, Libanius testifies to the frequent
employment of this method. We have seen that the <i>paedagogus</i>
appealed as a matter of course to the ‘argumentum ad baculum’;
we find in Libanius that the rhetor, the university teacher, did
likewise.</p>

<p>The general prospect of a schoolday may be described in
terms of the rod: ἔσονται δ’ ἐνεργοὶ μὲν ἱμάντες, ἐνεργοὶ δὲ
ῥάβδοι. He has a feeling that it is the only method of curing
idleness. Writing to a father whose son has complained to him
about a beating he had received, Libanius maintains that it is
absolutely necessary to treat slothfulness in that way.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>In the West we have the pathetic reminiscences of Augustine.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
No trouble was taken to explain to him the use or object of
lessons; all he knew was that if he did not learn he was beaten.
His prayer was to escape the rod, and very earnestly he prayed
(<i>rogabam Te parvus non parvo affectu</i>), for his blows were to him
‘magnum tunc et grave malum’. He speaks bitterly of the lack
of sympathy, which his sensitive nature felt more than the rest.
He is galled by the unfairness of a system which punished faults
in boys that were excused in men. ‘Maiorum nugae negotia
vocabantur, puerorum autem talia cum sint, puniuntur a maioribus.’
No proper balance was kept between lessons and play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, he confesses that he was often disobedient
through love of play, and admits ‘non enim discerem, nisi
cogerer’.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> Moreover, when he puts his punishments in the same
category as ‘temptationes martyrum’, we are inclined to think
him a sentimental prig. But there can be no doubt about the
excessive severity which was prevalent, and the fact that it
impressed Augustine’s mind to such an extent<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> is a measure of
its wrongness. The worst feature of the system was not so much
the general acquiescence in force as a scholastic panacea, but in
the rigidity which made no distinctions or allowances.</p>

<p>Gaul was no exception to the general tradition. We find in
Ausonius a fine gentleness of spirit and an elaborate courtesy;
he shows an almost un-Roman sympathy with Bissula, the
barbarian maid, and is fond of animals,<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> yet he is by no means
thoroughly converted from the old Roman harshness. The
gladiatorial games went on, and were significant of a prevalent
disregard for human life and personality. The old spirit flashes
forth under the veneer of culture; as when Ausonius surprises us
by saying blandly to his secretary, who had been branded for
running away: ‘on your branded face then, Pergamus, you have
borne the marks; letters which your hand neglected are inflicted
on your forehead.’<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>When he writes a letter of exhortation to his grandson we feel
that though there is something of the Greek spirit of pleasure in
education, and though he says<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> that the Muses, too, must play,</p>

<p class="noindent">yet there is an acquiescence in an almost savage system of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
control. Surliness and brutality on the part of the master is
accepted as one of the ills that flesh is heir to. It was not
always so, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">sic neque Peliaden terrebat Chiron Achillem:<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Chiron used to guide his pupils with gentle words (though
Juvenal represents Achilles as trembling before the rod).<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> But
that state of things belongs to a mythological age. The only
thing to do in the circumstances is to remember Vergil’s
dictum: ‘Degeneres animos timor arguit’, and face the master
as a brave warrior would his enemy.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>He pictures to his grandson the cane, the birch, the strap, and
the excited bustle of the school-benches (a confession that even
the most rigorous system of force could not keep perfect order).
These instruments are ‘the pomp of the place’ and the elements
in its scene of fear. But the great consolation is that both his
father and his mother went through the same storm of blows in
their childhood—an indication that the girls were not more
spared than the boys.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>The same assumption that flogging is the inevitable counterpart
of teaching is found in Sidonius.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> ‘Ferulae lectionis Maronianae’
becomes a synonym for education at a grammar school,
and the phrase ‘manum ferulae subducere’, in the sense of
attending school, goes down through the Middle Ages into
modern times. Even at the universities corporal punishment
was the usual thing. Eusebius, professor of philosophy at Lyons,
moulds his pupils ‘castigatoria severitate’.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>There are signs that the finer spirits, in theory at any rate,
felt that there was something wrong with all this external<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
rigour. Partly, no doubt, they followed the lead of Quintilian,
and partly, perhaps, there was a slow evolution past the stage of
mere militarism. Libanius boasts ἑτέρους δὲ ἴσμεν μυρίας
ῥάβδους ἀνηλωκότας,<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> but <i>he</i> had no need to; and experience
has taught him that the desired end is not always reached in this
way. ‘Now I avoided correction by means of blows, for I saw
that this method often had the opposite of the intended effect.’
We gather that the applause, which was usual in the rhetor’s
school,<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> often degenerated into rowdiness.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Yet we find that the
relation between master and pupil was often very hearty. Gregory
of Nazianzus tells of the farewell speeches, the laments, the tears,
which used to mark the day of parting.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>The opposition to the regular tradition is not so clearly formulated
in the West, but we find indications of a better ideal. In
the letter to his grandson, Ausonius does not praise existing conditions,
but rather accepts them as a necessary evil. Indeed, he
describes his own teaching in words which are so contrasted with
his picture of the ordinary school as to imply a direct criticism.</p>

<p>Paulinus of Pella has pleasant memories of his schooldays.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
The affection with which he writes to his teacher Ausonius<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
proves that the professor’s statements about the mildness of his
régime were not unfounded. He had referred to his work with
Paulinus as that of a yoke-mate, and his pupil replies:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Similarly, Sidonius speaks of his master Hoënius in a way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
which implies at least some degree of familiarity,<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> while his
general recollections of his schooldays seem to have been distinctly
pleasing.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<h5>(b) <i>Play.</i></h5>

<p>The Romans were not much interested in psychology, or in
the full development of personality. It is not surprising, therefore,
to find that practically all the child-games we know of in
the ancient world are Greek;<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> nor can we wonder that the
Gallo-Romans have left us no description of the sort of things
the child mind does, the way in which its personality develops,
when freed from the guidance of what is called education.</p>

<p>The subtler African mind of Augustine, however, has left us
some record of such games; and they are all so human and lifelike
that they may very well have been common not only to his
country, but also to his age.</p>

<p>He mentions ‘nuts’, handball, and bird-catching (<i>nucibus et
pilulis et passeribus</i>).<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Games of ball were, of course, common to
the children of all countries. We find Paulinus of Pella at the
age of fifteen wishing for a golden ball just arrived from Rome,<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
and Augustine describes how desperately keen he was on beating
a chum in the contest of the ball.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> As for the sparrows, ‘to
capture a bird’, says Bertrand in his <i>Life of St. Augustine</i>,<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> ‘that
winged, light and brilliant thing, is what all children long to do
in every country on earth’. The same author describes the
game of nuts as it is played in modern Africa. ‘A step of a
staircase is used as a table by the players, or the pavement of
a courtyard. Three shells are laid on the stone and a dried pea.
Then, with rapid, baffling movements, hands, brown and alert, fly
from one shell to another, shuffle them, mix them up, juggle the
dried pea sometimes under this shell, sometimes under that, and
the point is to guess which shell the pea has got under. By
means of certain astute methods an artful player can make the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
pea stick to his fingers, or to the inside of the shell, and the
opponent loses every time....’</p>

<p>It may be, too, that there were battles in which they took
sides as Carthaginians and Romans or Greeks and Trojans.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
Augustine loved to listen to fairy tales and was passionately
fond of watching plays and performances (<i>curiositate magis
magisque per oculos emicante in spectacula, ludos maiorum</i>).<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> The
spirit of adventure sometimes led him (as it has led children of
all ages) to break the laws of property, as the incident of the
pear-tree shows.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>Of the organized sport of youth and manhood we derive considerable
information from Sidonius, who frequently mentions
indoor games such as the <i>duodecim scripta</i>, a sort of backgammon,<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>
<i>fritilli</i><a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> and <i>pyrgus</i><a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> (in which dice [<i>tesserae</i>] were used),
as well as outdoor games. Paulinus of Pella tells us how he was
taken ill with fever at the age of fifteen, and his parents, thinking
his health more important than ‘doctae instructio linguae’,
followed the doctor’s advice and removed him from his school
at Bordeaux. Among the pleasures that were planned to
speed his recovery was hunting, which his father resumed
for his son’s sake.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> The equipment of a well-to-do Gallic
huntsman is described. The young Paulinus wishes for a
fine horse with extravagant saddle and bridle adornments
(<i>faleris ornatior</i>), a tall groom, a swift hound, and a smart
hawk. Fine clothes and scent from Arabia are also objects of
his desire.</p>

<p>The main details of the chase may easily be filled in from
Sidonius. From the description of Theodoric’s hunting skill, we
gather that spears were used as well as bows,<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> and that the
unsportsmanlike Roman habit of driving the game into nets was
practised in fifth-century Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> The hawk was regarded as an
indispensable item.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> There is river and lake fishing,<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> either with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
nets or with lines laid before nightfall,<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> and we hear of boat-racing<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
on lakes.</p>

<p>The game of ball, which is so frequently mentioned in Sidonius,
was undoubtedly the most popular outdoor game. It was played
by two persons,<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> or four,<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> or more than four,<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> and we gather that
there was a good deal of running about. That is practically all
we know of its rules, so that it is, strictly speaking, an assumption
to call it ‘tennis’.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> There were professional ball-throwers
or jugglers, and there is an epitaph, found at Narbonne, to one
Capito, a ‘pilarius’.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>The games of the circus were still popular. Majorian held
them at Arles,<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> and they are frequently mentioned in inscriptions,
as in the one at Arles in which some thousands of sesterces are
given ‘from the interest on which athletic or circus games are to
be given yearly’.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> At St. Pierre (Narbonne) a well-preserved
inscription was found to a man who had been ‘flamen’ of
Augustus and curator of the gladiatorial games, and had been
honoured ‘for his exceptional munificence in providing games’.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>
A Massilian inscription mentions ‘agonothet(ae) agoni(s)‘,<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> and
it is not impossible that the tradition of public games in Gaul
received an initial impetus from the Greek city of the south.</p>

<p>Against these athletic displays there seems to have been a good
deal of feeling. Pliny tells us that they were abolished at
Vienne by Trebonius Rufus, whose judgement, when appealed
against, was upheld by Junius Mauricus, who added ‘Vellem
etiam Romae tolli posset’. The reason given was a moral one.
‘Mores Viennensium infecerat, ut noster (agon) hic (Romae)
omnium’, says Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> voicing the traditional Roman opinion on
the subject. For Ennius had maintained: ‘Flagiti principium<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
est nudare inter civis corpora’;<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> and Cicero had followed up the
objection with ridicule: ‘Iuventutis vero exercitatio quam absurda
in gymnasiis’.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Seneca<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> excludes gymnastics from his
liberal studies, the main reason being ‘that they do not make for
virtue’. Quintilian is more moderate. He has no objection to
those who give them some little attention—‘paulum etiam
palaestricis vacaverunt’. But those who overdo it, who spend
part of their life in oil and part in wine, and so cloud the intellect,
he would keep at the greatest possible distance.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> There was
a feeling that the ‘Graeculus magister’ who took charge of the
exercises, instead of the old Roman veteran, was largely responsible
for the degeneration.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>Now the question arises whether gymnastic exercises were part
of the school programme, as in Greece, and whether there was
anything corresponding to the State-governed training of the
‘ephebi’. There seems to be considerable confusion of thought on
this point.</p>

<p>Denk<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> writes of the school buildings of Autun that they ‘lay
in the shadow of trees, in the neighbourhood of murmuring
fountains, the water of which was utilized by means of canals for
bathing and swimming establishments, while the Gymnasium
and the Palaestra provided for physical training and fitness’.
For this he quotes Bulaeus.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> But the reference is wrong. Elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
this unreliable author vaguely mentions a palaestra in
connexion with Autun, but cites no authority for his statement.
Nor does Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> whom he quotes, refer to anything of this
kind at Autun.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is the fact that neither Ausonius,
who was interested in education, nor Sidonius, who was interested
in games, says a word about gymnastics in schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>It is true that Sidonius, in describing the pictures of his
country seat at Avitacum, refers to wrestling bouts and to the
‘virga gymnasiarchorum’.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> But he is writing about artistic
representations, the content of which were probably literary and
without reference to Gaul, and the ‘virga gymnasiarchorum’, if,
like the description of the misers who are practised in the palaestra
of detraction and rub their limbs with poison instead of oil,<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
it has a realistic and a local ring, may refer with greater pertinence
to the public performances such as took place at the Ludi
Circenses.</p>

<p>Nor need we depend on the dangerous argument from silence.
The whole of Roman traditional sentiment was against such an
arrangement. Seneca, and the influential Quintilian, definitely
excluded it from their scheme of studies. The most that Quintilian
will concede is a master of deportment, who will teach the
art of gesticulation (<i>chironomia</i>, <i>lex gestus</i>), which is important
for the orator, and who will train in the pupil a decorous
grace of body. He will even go so far as to pass the war-dance
of the old Romans, with the qualification ‘nec ultra
pueriles annos retinebitur nec in his ipsis diu.’ But he clearly
means to exclude the gymnastic training as practised by the
Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p>It may be that the misconception of Denk partly lies in an
unconscious confusion of the word ‘gymnasium’. Early writers
like Plautus use it in the Greek sense of a school for gymnastic
exercises, but where we find it in later authors like Cicero and
Juvenal, the meaning is ‘public school or college’; and so it is
that Sidonius uses it.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> However that may be, it seems clear
that on the whole Cramer is right, when he says that in the
West gymnastics were never looked on as a part of public
education.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>In so far as they appeared at all in the Roman world, they
were due to original Greek influences, which, however, sometimes
lasted surprisingly long. We read, for example, that Augustus
was a constant spectator of the young men at their exercises,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
a considerable number of them (according to ancient custom)
still being found at Capreae<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>—which was under the Greek influence
of Naples. The inscriptions (as we have seen) point to the
existence of a <i>gymnasiarchia</i> which superintended officially the
physical exercises of the youths and children at Massilia,<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> though
how late it persisted we cannot say. It is probable that even in
the Greek city of the South the practice was discontinued in the
fourth and fifth centuries, for Massilia’s glory was a thing of
the past and her specifically Greek character had all but disappeared.</p>

<h5>(c) <i>Organization.</i></h5>

<p>The Maeniana at Autun attracted so much attention that
contemporary writers have left us a fairly complete picture of its
organization and its structure, which may be taken as typical of
the imperial schools in the larger cities of Gaul.</p>

<p>Autun, as we gather from the <i>Panegyrici Latini</i>, was full of
big buildings—temples of Janus, Pluto, Jove, Apollo, Hercules,
Venus, Proserpine, and Minerva—and possessed an amphitheatre,
a ‘naumachia’ or artificial lake for mock naval battles, fountains,
and aqueducts. To these, by the generosity of Constantius
Chlorus, there had been added at the end of the third century
the Maeniana, standing several stories high, in the most important
part of the town between the Capitol on the one hand and
the temples of Apollo and Herakles Musagetes on the other.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p>The schoolroom was probably of the traditional type. The
furniture was very simple. There were no desks (as we may
infer, e.g. from the well-known fresco at Herculanum and the
bas-relief at the Louvre)<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> and the pupils wrote on their knees.
The benches on which they sat were arranged around the chair of
the teacher. On the walls would be pictures of great historical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
events and geographical maps<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> according to Seneca’s principle
‘homines amplius oculis quam auribus credunt’.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>A gravestone relief discovered at Neumagen near Trèves shows
a tutor in a comfortable seat holding a roll of papyrus. On
either side sit two elder sons also reading from rolls, while
a younger son stands on the right with his wax tablets, furnished
with a handle, waiting for his writing lesson. The stone dates
from the first centuries of the Christian era, and probably represents
a private school in the home of a wealthy Gaul who wished
to boast of the good education which he had given his children.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>We do not hear much about private tuition, but the old Roman
custom of having a household slave to teach the rudiments must
have persisted in the wealthy families of Gaul. Paulinus of
Pella gives the impression that he had such training,<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> and
Sidonius writes to Simplicius<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> that it is his duty to admonish
his sons who are spoiled and refuse to submit to his assiduous care—which
suggests, as Hodgkin remarks, that he was their tutor.</p>

<p>In the schools a ‘chair’ (<i>cathedra</i>) was occupied by the teacher,
who was variously called ‘professor’, ‘praeceptor’, or, more
rarely, ‘magister’, and a <i>schola</i> meant the number of people
grouped under one <i>cathedra</i>, just as, in the official language of
the time, it meant a group of officials serving under one head—soldiers,
servants of the palace, and so forth.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>It is vain to look for any detailed scheme of arrangement in
the subjects of the schools. As we have seen, no definite compartments
can be distinguished in a subject like ‘Grammar’, nor
were the same number of subjects found in every school: Law,
Philosophy, and Medicine being taught in accordance with the
traditions and the size of the place. We are not even quite
clear as to the relation of the various grades of schools to one
another when we try to look at Gaul in particular. For a point
that is left vague in one’s mind after reading the authorities for
Gaul, is whether a distinction was made between the elementary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
school and the more advanced classes of the grammarian. Julius
Capitolinus, in his <i>Life of M. Antoninus</i>, the philosopher,<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> makes
it quite clear that a different master was used at Rome during
the second century for the two stages. ‘Usus est magistris ad
prima elementa Euforione litteratore ... usus est praeterea
grammaticis, Graeco, Alexandro Cotiaensi, Latinis, Trosio Apro
et Pollione et Eutychio Proculo Siccensi. Oratoribus usus est
Graecis Aninio Macro ... Latino Frontone Cornelio....’
Apuleius is just as clear. Drawn from the fountain of the
Muses, he says that the first goblet provides the instruction of
the elementary master, the second the teaching of the grammarian,
while the third provides the rhetor’s eloquence; and that
this is as far as most people go.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> And in our period Augustine
says that he was very fond of Latin literature ‘non quas primi
magistri sed quas docent qui grammatici vocantur’.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>There is, therefore, a clear traditional distinction in the Roman
world between the <i>primus magister</i> or <i>litterator</i>, the grammarian
and the rhetor, and perhaps we may see this division in the
stages of his career which Ausonius describes in the <i>Protrepticon</i>:<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>But in the Gallic writers of our period the distinction between
the first two stages is not at all clear. Ausonius, for example,
who never directly mentions the elementary school, says that
Macrinus was his first master, but he puts him under the heading
‘grammaticus’;<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> and in the Theodosian Code, while <i>grammatici</i>
and <i>rhetores</i> are always distinguished in the laws of the emperors
about teachers’ salaries and privileges, the elementary masters are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
never specially named. Probably the work of the <i>primus magister</i>
was considerably diminished in the schools by the fact that many
families employed private tutors for the initial stages of education;
and whether a school had a separate master for the lower
classes depended, no doubt, on its size and circumstances. The
whole of ‘primary’ education was loosely considered the province
of the <i>grammaticus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> who in most cases would have an assistant,
called by the less honourable name of <i>litterator</i><a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> or <i>primus
magister</i>. The <i>proscholus sive subdoctor</i>, mentioned by Ausonius,<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
seems to have been an assistant grammarian, different from his
chief only in social position. For the <i>proscholus</i> described seems
to have been as much above the ordinary grammarian in learning
as the grammarian was above the <i>litterator</i>. But his learning
was in inverse ratio to his pay, for Ausonius describes him as
‘Exili nostrae fucatus honore cathedrae’.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<p>Of Minervius, Ausonius says that he supplied the forum with
a thousand of his pupils, and added two thousand to the number
of the senate,<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> and Jullian<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> doubles this number (three thousand)
to get the total number which Minervius taught (for he was
rhetor at Constantinople and Rome as well as at Bordeaux) and,
dividing by thirty (the probable number of his teaching years),
allots to him two hundred students per annum. But Ausonius’s
style and character hardly admit of such mathematical speculation.
He was much too vague and careless about things to make
a calculation of this kind anything but extremely uncertain. The
most we can say is that Bordeaux, the most flourishing Gallic
university of the fourth century, must have had an exceptionally
large number of students, several hundred, perhaps, drawn from
all parts of Gaul, just as the professors sometimes came from
Greece or Sicily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>Education was begun at an early age. Paulinus of Pella
began when he was five,<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> and Ausonius took charge of children
in their infancy.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> At fourteen or fifteen the boy usually left the
grammarian. Paulinus, who was probably retarded by the
difficulty he found with Latin, was still in his grammarian’s
school at fifteen.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> If, as it appears, the law-course lasted five
years, law students who went to Rome from Gaul would spend
only a year or so in the school of the rhetor. For the emperor
forbade students to continue their studies at Rome after the age
of twenty, when they were removed by force if they omitted to
return. ‘His sane qui sedulo operam professoribus navant, usque
ad vicesimum aetatis suae annum Romae liceat commorari. Post
id vero tempus qui neglexerit sponte remeare, sollicitudine praefecturae
etiam invitus<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> ad patriam revertatur.’<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> Such was
the stringent enactment of Valentinian in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 370. We hear
of students attached to the ‘Corpora’ who continued their
studies at Rome after their twentieth year.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> But it appears that
the general age for leaving the rhetor’s school was, at any rate,
before twenty.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Pueros ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">formasti rhetor metam prope puberis aevi,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">says Ausonius to Exsuperius,<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> which means that fifteen was
a common age for boys to be at the rhetor’s school.</p>

<p>About school-hours we know very little. It does not seem
likely that the grammarian had so many hours per week for each
of the seven liberal arts. What he aimed at was extensive
reading, primarily for philological and literary knowledge, and
only secondarily for such historical and scientific facts as came
under Capella’s various heads. ‘The grammarian’, says Seneca,
‘attends to language, and, if he wishes to go farther afield, to
history, while the utmost limit of his activities is poetry.’<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> ‘If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
he wishes to go farther afield’ is significant: the system was an
elastic one.</p>

<p>Of the total number of teaching hours there is only one indication.
Ausonius sends the teacher Ursulus six philippi, the usual
New Year’s gift from the emperor which Ursulus had not
received, and says that they are ‘As many as the men to whom
the fates of the Romans and the Albans were entrusted, and as
many as his teaching hours at school and the hours he sits at
home’.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>Denk, therefore, seems to be wrong when he says of the
teachers<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> that they had no limitations of subject or method or
time.</p>

<p>When this schoolday of six hours started in Gaul we do not
know; but it is probable that it began fairly early in the morning
and went on into the early afternoon. This was the case at
Antioch in the fourth century;<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> and Augustine says that the
teacher is kept busy in the hours before noon.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p>With regard to examinations we find nothing definite, but
there is a passage in the famous law of 370<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> which points to the
application of some test. The emperor wants a report from
the prefect of Rome, with a view to imperial appointments, of
all students who have completed their course and are going back
to the provinces. Moreover, such reports (<i>breves</i>) must be lodged
at the imperial office every year. ‘Similes autem breves etiam
ad scrinia mansuetudinis nostrae annis singulis dirigantur, quo
meritis singulorum institutionibusque conpertis, utrum quandoque
nobis sint necessarii iudicemus.’</p>

<p>From a few scattered hints it looks as if there was some sort
of academic dress. Domitius teaches Terence at Ameria, wrapped
in a thick cloak (<i>endromidatus</i>) though the weather is warm<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
picture which reminds us of Augustine’s ‘paenulati magistri’.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
At Antioch the rhetor wore a philosopher’s mantle<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> (<i>tribon</i>),
a costume which was not unknown in Gaul, for Sidonius remarks
that Claudianus, though a philosopher, wore ordinary dress.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p>That there were holidays at regular intervals is clear from
Ausonius’s letter to his grandson:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sunt etiam musis sua ludicra: mixta camenis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">otia sunt ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">set requie studiique vices <i>rata tempora servant</i>.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Sidonius invites Domitius to come and share the joys of
the country after his laborious teaching in the stuffy schoolroom.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

<p>When exactly the vacations began and how long they lasted
in Gaul we do not know, but it is probable that the order and
duration of the Roman holidays were imitated. Ausonius’s
verses in the ‘Thirty days hath September’ style on the Feriae
Romanae<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> indicate that the Roman holidays existed at least in
the memory of the schoolboy. Tertullian implies that they
existed also in his experience, though less splendid in the
provinces than at Rome (<i>minore cura per provincias pro minoribus
viribus administrantur</i>).<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> We hear of ‘Florales Ludi’,
which were different from the Roman Floralia, in connexion with
the academy of Toulouse. There were ‘Agones rhetorici et
poetici quotannis celebrari soliti, quique etiamnum hodie Kalendis
Maii (<i>sic</i>) quotannis in domo publica committuntur’.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> It is
doubtful when these games were first introduced. Justinus
mentions them in his description of the foundation of Massilia.
Tradition at Toulouse said they were instituted by a maiden of
literary tastes, Clementia Isaura; another version is that she
merely renewed them. She is mentioned in the <i>Agonisticon</i> of
one Petrus Faber of Toulouse in the sixteenth century, and
Papyrius Massonius wrote an ‘Elogium Clementiae Isaurae’.
They set up a statue to her on which the inscription ran:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
‘Clementia Isaura ... forum frumentarium, vinarium, piscarium
et olitorium ... Capitolinis populoque Tolosano legavit, hac
lege ut quotannis ludos Florales in aedem publicam quam ipsa
sua impensa extruxit celebrent....’</p>

<p>On such occasions a child would be taken by his parent to see
the show, though he would not be allowed a seat (<i>non sedens
propter aetatem</i>),<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> and at festivals such as those of St. Just he
would enjoy a game of ball or dice.<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>A calendar of about the middle of the fourth century would,
Jullian<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> supposes, taking the evidence of Ausonius’s poem ‘de
Feriis’, the calendar of Philocalus, and the Christian writers, show
about eighty-nine holidays, of which he considers six doubtful.
In the meantime Christian festivals were increasingly claiming
recognition. Already in 321 we find Constantine prohibiting
the exercise of certain trades on Sunday,<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> and in 389 the Biblical
conception of Sunday is definitely recognized<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> (<i>solis die quem
dominicum rite dixere maiores</i>) and a general cessation of business
is enjoined. In the same year the pagan festivals were cut
down; only the summer and autumn festivals (described, even
in the law, with the usual literary diffuseness of the time), the
New Year holidays, and the foundation-days of Rome and Constantinople
were to remain.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> On the other hand, shows on
Sunday were forbidden, ‘so that the sacred rites enjoined by the
Christian law should not be disturbed by any gathering of
shows’<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 392), and at Easter the business of the forum and
of the law courts<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> was suspended. In theory, therefore, there was
a decrease in pagan and an increase in Christian holidays. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
practice, however, pagan festivals long persisted,<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> and it is
significant of the tenacity of paganism that the Lupercalia was
celebrated in the fifth century. Very often the church kept the
old festivals, merely changing their meaning.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the pagan festivals were observed
as school holidays: the references in Horace and his contemporaries
and the Roman conception of <i>festus</i>, <i>fastus</i>, <i>feriae</i>, as
indicating solemnity and reverence,<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> point to this conclusion.
Such was evidently the case in the fourth-century Italian schools,
for Augustine waits to resign his professorship until the holidays
of the ‘Vindemia’.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>Of the Christian festivals it is harder to judge, especially after
the revival of paganism under Julian at the beginning of our
period. But it is probable that while the earlier laws (e.g. those
of Constantine) had no widespread effect on the schools, the
increasing emphasis laid on Christian festivals, passing through
the fourth and fifth centuries into the Germanic period of Gaul,
must have meant the recognition of Sundays and such festivals
as Easter in the school curriculum.</p>

<p>Besides the public festivals there was the long vacation, lasting
from the end of July till the beginning of October.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> At Antioch,
similarly, classes were taken only in the winter and in the spring,<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
the vacation lasting from midsummer till the beginning of
winter. When the vacation came, the Antioch rhetors used to
go in for public speeches and imperial panegyrics.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, any special event produced a holiday. At Antioch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
any festive occasions, funerals,<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> or civil commotions,<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> served to
close the schoolrooms. On the occasion of the marriage of
Ricimer with the daughter of Anthemius, the schools of Gaul
enjoyed a holiday.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> Apparently the length of the holiday was
not controlled by organized rules, and this time it lasted so long
that even Sidonius protested.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> ‘<i>Tandem</i>’, he says, ‘reditum est
in publicam serietatem, quae rebus actitandis ianuam campumque
patefecit.’</p>

<p>It is interesting to find signs of a common life among the
students, the beginnings of a residential university. Aulus
Gellius claims the authority of Pythagoras for this mode of life.
‘Here is another point we must not omit: all the students of
Pythagoras, as soon as they had been admitted into that “corps”
of his, pooled all their possessions, slaves, or money, and so
a close and lasting society was formed.’<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Suetonius tells of one
C. Albucius Silus of Novaria (Cisalpine Gaul) who came to
Rome and was received into the ‘contubernium’ of Plancus, the
orator, i.e. lived under the same roof, became a ‘convictor’ with
him.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> ‘You can enjoy the possession of no good thing’, Seneca
says, ‘without some one to share it.’ You will gain more by
talking and living with (<i>convictus</i>) people than from set speeches.
Cleanthes could never have interpreted the philosophy of Zeno if
he had merely attended his lectures. But he lived with him,
examined his private life, and watched him to see if he practised
what he preached.<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> Similarly, Plato and Aristotle and the rest
learned more from the conduct than the words of Socrates, and
‘Metrodorus, Hermarchus, and Polyaenus were made great not by
the school of Epicurus, but by living with him (<i>contubernium</i>).’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Gellius gives many examples of this sort of literary fellowship.
While master and students dined together, one of the servitors
would read some passage from a Greek or Latin author, and if
a difficulty arose the master explained. So at the table of
Favorinus ‘servus assistens mensae eius legere inceptabat....’
and a discussion was introduced by the philosopher on the word
‘parcus’.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Literary criticism was the favourite thing, as when
the <i>Bucolics</i> of Vergil and Theocritus were read together at
a dinner, and it was noticed that Vergil had left alone passages
which contained the peculiar Greek sweetness but could not and
should not be translated.<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>We have no direct data for supposing that this system was
followed in Gaul in our period; but the Favorinus mentioned in
Gellius came from Arles, and there appear to have been ‘contubernia’
in Massilia.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Moreover, the ‘Platonic clubs’ of
Sidonius and the general social temper of the Bordeaux professors
make it likely that something of the kind was found at the
Gallic universities.</p>

<p>As to the payment of teachers, it is clear that before Vespasian
it was very unequal. Verrius Flaccus, who was tutor to the
children of Augustus, received a salary of 100,000 sesterces
(£1,000).<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> Even the infamous Palaemon, to whom parents were
forbidden to send their children by Tiberius and Claudius, got as
much as 40,000 sesterces. Martial takes a pessimistic view.
In his advice to a friend on a career for his son he counsels: Let
him avoid grammarians and rhetoricians if he wants to make
money:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Artes discere vult pecuniosas?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fac, discat, citharoedus aut choraules.<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Gaul, it appears, teachers were paid by the State before
this was the case at Rome; for Strabo remarks in the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> that he found State-appointed teachers there.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> But
there must have been great lack of organization and equality
because State-payment meant, at that time, payment by the
municipal town, which could not always provide proper security.
Security, indeed, became more and more shaken, and the improvement
made by Vespasian when he fixed the teachers’ salaries was
a much-needed measure. In the famous decree of 376 Gratian
and Valentinian ratified this enactment.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> Rhetoricians are to
receive twenty-four <i>annonae</i><a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> from the treasury, Greek and Latin
grammarians, twelve. The chief cities of the provinces are
encouraged to elect professors who are to be paid according to
the standard fixed by the emperors. Trèves, the imperial favourite,
gets something more (<i>uberius aliquid</i>), thirty annonae for
a rhetor and twenty for a grammarian.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the emperors tried to monopolize
education. Julian’s decree<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> that the appointment of all teachers
was to be subject to the imperial approval, and the law of
Theodosius and Valentinian in the next century forbidding all
public schools outside the imperial academy, are illustrations of
this tendency. Nevertheless, there must have been a large
number of private-school teachers who were not paid by the
State. The imperial legislation of the later empire could not
have done away entirely with so established and widespread
a class of men. They survived, especially in elementary education,
and possibly their number exceeded that of the officially
State-paid teachers.</p>

<p>The law makes it quite clear that the State-paid school and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
university teachers<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> were, at one time, dependent on their towns
for pay; and the frequent mandates of the emperors to the
municipalities not to neglect these salaries show that they were
not always prompt in paying. Symmachus, also, complains of
the withholding of salaries;<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> and it has been suggested in this
connexion that the teachers were unpopular because they were
mostly pagans. It is more likely that their unpopularity was
due to the fact that their teaching did not touch the mass of the
population, who nevertheless had to support them. That the
municipal salary stopped when the imperial one came into existence
seems unlikely. Denk thinks that the imperial-paid
‘auditoria’ were distinct from the lower municipal-paid schools,<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
but probably the individual cities went on contributing part of
the professors’ salaries, even after the law of Gratian.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> As to
the amount received, the impression made by the upper circle of
the Bordeaux professors is certainly one of material prosperity.
Marcellus of Narbo,<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> Sedatus of Toulouse,<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> and Exsuperius<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> did
very well for themselves, and Eumenius considers his salary of
£5,000 as nothing extraordinary: ‘multo maiora et prius et
postea praemia contulerunt’ (<i>sc.</i> <i>principes</i>).<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Even of the grammarian
Marcellus, Ausonius could say that riches came by teaching:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mox schola ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grammatici nomen divitiasque dedit.<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On the other hand the less distinguished seem to have had
a disproportionately small salary. The frequent application of
the epithet ‘sterilis’ or ‘exilis’ to the chair of the grammarian
is a feature of Ausonius’s picture of them.</p>

<p>Besides the imperial and the municipal support there were the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
gifts from the emperor,<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> and the possibility of presents from the
family of the pupils—a practice which is still very much in
evidence in many country centres. Finally, there were the fees
from the pupils, part of which seems to have been paid directly
to the teacher.</p>

<p>The class fee (<i>merces</i>, <i>minerval</i>) seems to have been stipulated
for by the rhetors individually. Axius asks Merula in Varro’s
<i>De Re Rustica</i>,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> ‘to be his master in the shepherd’s art’,
and the reply is, imitating the practice of the rhetors, ‘Yes, as
soon as you promise to pay my fee’ (<i>minerval</i>). Juvenal refers
to the same practice:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Quantum vis stipulare, et protinus accipe quod do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ut toties illum pater audiat.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bulaeus says that the amount of the fee was sometimes left to
the generosity of the parents.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> He can hardly be referring to
a common practice. The fourth century was far too business-like
for this sort of thing. Most of the teachers who were in
a position to do so probably demanded a large fee, like Exsuperius.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>
How far this bargaining went on after the law of Gratian we
cannot tell: but the fact that it went on after Vespasian had
fixed the salaries shows that it was not necessarily stopped in
376. Much more liberal was the East. Lectures at Antioch
were open to all, even to pupils of other rhetors:<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> and sometimes
invitations to attend were sent round by the servant of the
lecturer.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p>As to the number of the professors appointed little is known.
Probably from what Ausonius says there were ten at Bordeaux,
six ‘grammatici’ and four ‘rhetores’—the highest number, Jullian
thinks, that Bordeaux ever reached. At Constantinople Theodosius
appointed in 425 to his special <i>auditorium</i><a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> three rhetors and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
ten grammarians for Latin, five rhetors and ten grammarians for
Greek, one professor of philosophy, and two for law. But this
is Eastern exuberance. Trèves, the imperial favourite, had only
two or three rhetoricians, one Latin grammarian, and one Greek
grammarian—a post which could not always be filled.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

<p>Denk, in remarking that the number of teachers was thus
definitely fixed, adds that there is no trace of a principal who
gave direction to the work of the students.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> Now it is true that
there was no definite organization, but it seems very probable
that the emperors, when they interested themselves in a school
and appointed teachers, would have some one at the head of the
establishment to facilitate communication between the imperial
offices and the school. Moreover, it is a natural and traditional
thing the world over for a group of men more or less permanently
banded together to have a chief. The Druids had their leader,<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>
and among the Persian Magi there was an archimagus. Besides,
we have at least one ‘trace’ which Denk does not notice.
Eumenius, as head of the Maeniana, was called <i>moderator</i>, which
looks like an official title. And in the Christian schools it was
a common thing to have a head (<i>primicerius</i>), as will be shown
later.</p>

<p>Jullian<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> notices as a praiseworthy feature of the fourth-century
educational system that the master passed on with his pupils as
they advanced from stage to stage. Our author reads into his
idealized fourth century a method which has long been practised
by the Jesuits. But perhaps the wish is father to the thought.
For it is clear that this could not, in the majority of cases, apply
to the elementary master, whose intellectual limitations would
effectually prevent him from taking the higher classes. Ausonius
tells us as much.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> Such teachers were ‘humili loco ac merito’.
He mentions Romulus and Corinthius<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> as the Greek grammarians
who taught him ‘primis in annis’, and they do not appear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
again in the list of his masters. When quite young he was put
under his uncle Arborius (<i>qui me lactantem, puerum iuvenemque
virumque | artibus ornasti</i>),<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> who may have been a kind of general
tutor to him at that time. When he was about ten years old he
went to Toulouse (<i>c.</i> <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 320) and was taught for eight years in
the school of Arborius, who in 328 was appointed tutor to one
of the sons of Constantine at Constantinople,<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> where he died.
Ausonius then returned to Bordeaux where he seems to have
continued his studies in the rhetorical school, studying under
Minervius,<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> and Luciolus,<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> who was once his fellow student, and
probably under Alcimus<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> and Delphidius,<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> while Staphylius took
the place of Arborius<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> as general tutor:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tu mihi quod genitor, quod avunculus, unus utrumque</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">alter ut Ausonius, alter ut Arborius.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">All these later masters, like Minervius, are spoken of distinctly
as ‘rhetor’ or ‘orator’, just as his early masters are distinguished
as ‘grammatici’.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>Ausonius’s experience as pupil, therefore, seems to contradict
the statement that the master followed his students from class to
class. But it may be argued that the scheme was upset in
Ausonius’s case by his temporary removal to Toulouse, and his
experience as master may be urged. This is a plausible contention.
For he tells us in the <i>Protrepticon</i> of three stages in his
career corresponding presumably to those of the litterator, the
grammarian, and the rhetor. Yet Jullian’s supposition is not
therefore true. Not every primary master was an Ausonius
who could rise to the top of his profession and become an
imperial tutor. Obviously there were a large number who found,
as they left, the teaching profession a poor and dreary task.
The grammarians whom Ausonius mentions,<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> except, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Nepotianus,<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> did not rise to the higher position, and some, in
their old age, even lost the little glory they had achieved, as
Anastasius did.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> Moreover, Ausonius does not say that his
promotion kept pace with the advance of his students. The
terms he uses are quite vague (<i>mox</i>, <i>idem</i>). And even supposing
the master could in this way remain with his pupils, what
happened when they had reached the highest stage? Jullian
maintains that he started at the bottom again with a new class:
‘Le même homme était tour à tour professeur de grammaire et
rhéteur: il lui arrivait ainsi de suivre ses élèves, de les accompagner
de classe en classe.’<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p>Now this is reducing the matter to an absurdity. The fixity
of the distinction between grammarian and rhetor is so striking
in all Latin literature, and particularly in Ausonius, that the
system, however desirable, would have been impossible. It is
quite clear that there was a definite status attached to the
positions,<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> and the Theodosian Code prescribes different salaries.
Is it conceivable (to mention no other objections) that a man
would be constantly changing his social standing and his salary
in order to accompany his class from stage to stage?</p>

<p>The most we can say is that the connexion between the lower
and higher forms of education was sufficiently close (as in France
to-day) to allow a man of merit to rise from the lowest to the
highest. This is proved by Ausonius’s case, and Denk is not
stating the whole truth when he says that the teachers were
independent of one another.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> There was a certain amount of
independence, no doubt, between grammarian and grammarian,
or rhetor and rhetor, but between the grammatical school and
that of the rhetorician there was a considerable degree of interdependence.</p>

<h3>C. OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL</h3>

<h4>(i) <span class="smcap">Administrative and Social Conditions</span></h4>

<p>Before we can understand the working of the school and see
it in its proper perspective, before we can grasp the inner meaning
of the system and appreciate its merits and demerits,
something must be known about the society in which the school
flourished and of the imperial organization which gave direction
to that society. As Guizot said in his <i>History of Civilization</i>,
study must proceed from without to within.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to give a detailed account of a subject so well
worn, but a brief summary of such points as bear on education is
necessary.</p>

<p>An outstanding feature in the development of the later empire
is the growth of civil power. The great military commands, so
common previously, become more and more impossible, owing to
greater subdivision. The imperial army was divided into one
hundred and twenty<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> parts, as against forty-five at the end of
Trajan’s reign, and of these Gaul had fifteen. The civil power
was so far recognized that military and civil offices were separated.
The civil administrator of a province was called ‘proconsul’
or ‘consular’ (which did not necessarily mean ex-consul) according
to whether the province was reckoned as ‘old’ or not. Above
him were the four supreme civil authorities of the empire, the
Praefectus Praetorio (who had become a civil magistrate after
the Praetorian Cohorts had destroyed themselves by supporting
Maxentius against Constantine), the Praefectus Galliarum, the
Praefectus Italiae, and the Praefectus Illyrici et Orientis. It is
well to bear in mind the status of these officials, for it will help
us to understand the meaning of the fact that a schoolmaster
like Ausonius became ‘praefectus Galliarum’. Each praefecture
was divided into ‘dioceses’ and at the head of each was a
‘Vicarius’. The tenants of the higher offices were divided, according
to the honour of their position, into ‘Illustres’, ‘Spectabiles’,
and ‘Clarissimi’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>An important point in this system is that there was no continuous
official chain passing down from the emperor to the
lowest official; the emperor could interfere at any point (a
particular in which the Pope resembles the Roman emperors)
and every official was regarded as directly responsible to him,
though he was controlled by his superior official as well. Functionaries
were made to change places rapidly, so as to prevent
a man from obtaining undue influence by long residence in one
place. Thus, though the growth of civil power was favourable
to the development of schools, the coercive spirit which is
destructive of true education remained. On the one hand,
education was encouraged by the various departments of the
extensive<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Civil Service—the secretariat (<i>scrinium ab epistulis</i>),
the Record Office (<i>a memoria</i>), the office for legal documents (<i>a
libellis</i>), and that for the emperor’s engagements and arrangements
(<i>scrinium dispositionum</i>); and on the other hand, the
controller of the civil service (<i>magister officiorum</i>) sent forth his
secret service men (<i>schola agentium in rebus</i>), who, beginning
their career by superintending the post service (<i>curiosi</i>), became
a pregnant source of corruption and oppression. Extraordinarily
efficient as the imperial civil service was, it had this important
loophole of corruption, while oppression was possible
everywhere.</p>

<p>The centre of the bureaucracy was the ‘Consistorium’ or
Privy Council.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> Certain high officials became ‘comites consistoriani’,
and special people were called in for particular points.
The position of the senate in this scheme of things is interesting
from Ausonius’s statement that Minervius added to it two
thousand members.<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> The number of members tended to grow
enormously owing to the increasing use made by the emperor of
his ‘ius adlectionis et loco movendi’, and the ‘ordo senatorius’
was still in existence. Ultimately, all who were ‘clarissimi’
belonged to the senate. But in practice only the higher officials,
the priests, and the ‘consulares’ actually took part in the proceedings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
which tended to become municipal rather than imperial.
The position of the senate, therefore, regarded as an imperial
body, was merely nominal, though it was of considerable local
importance. Its chief function was to provide ‘panem et circenses’,
paid for by the holders of the consulship, the praetorship,
and the quaestorship, which alone survived from the old ‘cursus
honorum’. At the head of the senate was the ‘praefectus urbi’,
whose powers were wide and undefined. Rome’s loss of dignity,
with the emperors frequently residing in Gaul and elsewhere,
affected the prestige of the senate, which still met in the
‘eternal city’. Yet as the emperors became weaker we find the
senate growing in importance, and during the last twenty-five
years of the Western Empire its activity is remarkable.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>Society in Gaul during the fourth and fifth centuries may be
divided into four classes:<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> (1) the senators, (2) the curiales,
(3) the common people, and (4) the slaves.</p>

<p>The senators were exempt from municipal offices and from
torture, and had a right to be tried in a special court. These
privileges were hereditary, though subject to the emperor’s good
pleasure, and were counterbalanced by the heavy taxes, especially
the senatorial ‘aurum oblaticium’. Distinguished from this
political aristocracy were the ‘curiales’ or ‘decuriones’, members
of the ‘curia’ or municipal council of their town. Entry into
the class was by nomination, and could not be refused by anybody
who had the property qualification, and, once procured, it
was hereditary. It was a most unpopular honour,<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> because it
involved the collection of taxes, for which the ‘decurio’ was
financially responsible. In practice it was often a ruinous
position, since no effective jurisdiction was open to the collector.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
In the fourth century there were about one hundred decurions
in each town. The plebs comprised petty landowners, tradesmen,
and free artisans. Whereas under the republic slaves worked
for the family, and trade was domestic, free men now worked
for the State, and trade became public. Guilds had sprung up
under the republic, but, whereas they were then free, the
empire more and more destroyed their liberty. Augustus made
them dependent on the will of the prince and the senate, and
in our period we find them regarded as rendering compulsory
services under the tutelage of the emperor. What is more, the
Theodosian Code proves that they had become <i>hereditary</i>.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the slaves may be classified as domestic and rural, the
latter comprising many different grades, from serfs of the soil
to comparatively free labourers.</p>

<p>In spite of this rigid suppression of spontaneity and freedom,
which is seen also in Diocletian’s Edict fixing the prices throughout
the empire, there is a gain in other directions. The ‘societates
publicanorum’ ceased to exist, and the provincial was less
exposed to capricious plunder, which in some cases, however,
was removed only to admit organized robbery. Diocletian had
levelled the inequality of taxation, but had not made an equal
oppression impossible. Yet there was the boon of peace, and the
genuine efforts to help provincials on the part of emperors like
Julian. He greatly reduced the land tax<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> and administered
justice in person, revising the decisions of judges, and summarily
dismissing corrupt officials. The supply of slaves had palpably
decreased, for wars of conquest had ceased, and the Germanic
prisoners, having been found to be unmanageable, had been
granted a certain amount of independence. We find that as much
as two hundred ‘aurei’ was paid for a single slave; and if we
are forced to conclude that the slave in question must have been
of a very special kind, we must grant that even so the price had
risen enormously. This meant that people had to fall back on
their own resources more frequently: a local and provincial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
independence was fostered, and we have something more nearly
approaching ‘natural economy’.</p>

<p>Such was the system of which the fourth and fifth centuries
witnessed the failure. As time went on taxes continued to be
oppressive,<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> the bankruptcy that inevitably resulted from keeping
an army continuously on a war footing became more apparent,
and the security afforded by the empire became less and less.
A weak ruler in a despotic state makes room for all manner of
corruption, and under the weak emperors of the later empire
this result is evident from ‘the frequent creation of new offices
whose object was to curb the corruption of the old’.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> When
the imperial defence at length breaks down before the repeated
waves of barbarian invasion, we feel that the severance of Gaul
from an imperial government so rigid and so inelastic has
merely been forestalled: it would have come in any case.</p>

<p>The deadening effect of this system is evident. It left no
room for life and growth; spontaneity and genius were stifled,
and progress checked. Naturalness and truth were not at
home in this age of officialdom and adulation. The Theodosian
Code bears witness to the elaborate and involved etiquette which
revelled in high-sounding names,—‘tua sublimitas, tua excelsitas,
tua magnificentia, praecelsa sinceritas tua’,<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> &amp;c.—to which even
the emperors were bound by the enormous stress which public
opinion laid on these distinctions. Not that this Byzantine
etiquette was wholly evil. As a means of counteracting the
confusion which had previously reigned, of creating a respect for
the person of the emperor which meant better order and fewer
rebellions, it was a master-stroke on the part of Diocletian.
But its evil effects in the direction of artificiality in times when
the emperors could, with less justice, be called ‘divine’ is not
to be denied.</p>

<p>But by the side of this mechanical pagan society there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
growing up at this time ‘another society, young, energetic,
fruitful of results—the ecclesiastical society. It was around
this society that the people rallied ... the senatorial and curial
aristocracy was a mere phantom: the clergy became the real
aristocracy.’<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>In this society lay the hope of the future.</p>

<h4>(ii) <span class="smcap">Class Distinction and Education</span></h4>

<p>The cast-iron rigidity of class distinctions is apparent even
from the slight foregoing sketch of social conditions. Yet it is
worth while dwelling on it a little longer in view of the statements
that have been made. Every man had his place allotted
to him by the divine will of the emperor, and there he must
remain on pain of committing sacrilege. Valentinianus (says
the emperor in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 384) has prescribed for every rank its proper
place and worth. If, therefore, any one occupies a position not
his own, let him not plead ignorance. He stands convicted of
sacrilege, for he has neglected the divine commands of the
emperor.<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> This was the general scheme of Roman society. Nor
was it modified to any great extent in Gaul by the admixture
of the Visigoths, who had much the same system.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> How did
its details affect education in Gaul? Jullian maintains that
practically every free-born child regularly attended the schools,
which were equally accessible, he thinks, to the children of
freedmen.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> He does not deny that distinctions were rigid and
many: ‘le <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>ᵉ siècle est, comme le <span class="allsmcap">XIII</span>ᵉ, un siècle de privilèges,
de distinctions et de hiérarchie’: but he thinks that all the classes
were equal in the matter of education and that rank disappeared
in the school.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> In a similar strain Denk argues that the curials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
must have had a considerable school training in order to fit
them for the management of municipal affairs. ‘In order to
perform such duties thoroughly they must have had the necessary
knowledge: and this they must have obtained from the
school.’<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>As for the free artisans and the slaves, Denk cites the education
of the old Roman slaves. Cato had demanded that household
slaves should be able to read and write, and Mommsen
says<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> that the lower classes had considerable knowledge of
reading, writing, and arithmetic. Similarly, Lavisse says<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> that
the uneducated, on the whole, could not have been too numerous,
for even the humble sergeant had to be able to read the word of
command on the tablets, and there were schools for the sons of
veterans.</p>

<p>What authority Jullian has for saying that the distinction
between classes broke down in the matter of education he does
not say; and an examination of the Theodosian Code and of
contemporary authorities makes it entirely improbable.</p>

<p>First of all, it was only the upper class that could compete for
the higher grades of imperial office, which was regarded as the
prize of education. The pride which Ausonius took in his
imperial honours is only half concealed,<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> and he puts before his
grandson the same goal of studies.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>This particular incentive to education was lacking in all but
the senatorial class, from which, Jullian confesses,<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> the greatest
number of pupils was drawn. Freedmen were definitely excluded
by law. The emperors of 426 forbade all of their station to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
stand for the higher offices, or to be admitted as soldiers of the
Imperial Guard.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>The laws which prevented the curial from leaving his class<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>
were many and stringent. Once a curial, always a curial, and
not even flight from his town could save him. The prize of five
‘aurei’ offered by the government would be sure to find him
a captor.</p>

<p>Denk’s argument that the curial must have had a school
training to manage municipal affairs does not go very far. The
reading, writing, and arithmetic taught by the ‘litterator’ he
would certainly need, but there is no reason for supposing that
he went any further. The respectable curial on his freehold
farm probably had little incentive to education, and found no
inspiration in his forced work of somewhat anxious tax-gathering.
He would probably have considered the poetical flourishes of the
rhetor beside the point for his son. It would be much more
important for him to learn the practical wisdom which his
father had formulated as to the best methods of making people
pay their taxes or of managing the problems of agriculture.</p>

<p>Now it is true that a law of Constantius<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> enacts that no one
shall attain to the first rank in the ‘ordo decurialis’ unless he has
passed through a course of studies. But firstly, the law applies
technically only to the city of Rome, and its ‘decuriae’;
secondly, the amount of education required was not excessive:
all the emperor wanted was that a man of the first rank should
be able to speak grammatically (<i>ita esse litteris expolitum, ut citra
offensam vitii ex eodem verba procedant</i>); and finally, the regulation
that this elementary knowledge was specially laid down as
a qualification for the first rank (<i>librarii</i>) suggests that the other
two (<i>fiscales et censuales</i>) were frequently held without such
proficiency.</p>

<p>If the law tended to stifle the curial’s interest in education,
much more was this so with those who belonged to a lower grade.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
The incentive needed there was greater and the incentive given,
less. The work of the artisans belonging to the rigidly separated
‘collegia’ was harder, though it varied with the trade. The
bakers’ guild was not far removed from slavery. Here, too,
frequent flight from the class points to oppression. The tendency
to learn only the practical tricks necessary to make the trade
a paying one must have been even more accentuated. For
where there is no prospect except the drudgery of the trade in
which he grew up, it must be an exceptional man who will take
an interest in education or awaken it in his son. Even the
school of the ‘litterator’ must have been a mystery to many of
these ‘corporati’. Moreover, intermarriage between the classes
was regarded with horror, and forbidden on the severest penalties.
Senators or men who ranked as ‘perfectissimi’, or ‘duumviri’,
or ‘quinquennales’, or ‘flamines’, or ‘sacerdotes’, suffered
‘infamia’ if they married a freedwoman or the daughter of
a freedwoman, an actress or the daughter of an actress, a
shopkeeper (<i>tabernarius</i>) or the daughter of a shopkeeper, or any
one of low standing.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

<p>Whatever we may think of the wisdom of such a measure, one
thing is clear: the difficulty of imagining that all ranks were
levelled, as Jullian says, in the school, and that the son of a
senator sat on the same benches as the sons of freedmen.</p>

<p>Further, the tendency of the emperors to restrict people to the
same place must also have had an effect on education.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> For the
imperial policy aimed at uniformity and immobility, and in
attaining them it lost life and progress. The discouragement of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
travel must have meant a restriction of knowledge and a strangling
of that wonder which is stimulated by new scenes, and is,
as Plato said, the beginning of philosophy.</p>

<p>Again, the inspiration which comes from the feeling of citizenship,
the realization of being a living member of a group and
helping to further its ends, was crushed out by the mechanical
fiscal system of the empire. Men like Claudian and Sidonius
might write with an enthusiasm inspired by this feeling, but
what chance was there for the anxious curial or the fettered
artisan to share this inspiration? For him the round of daily
duty was too narrow or too relentless, to allow much room for
ideals. ‘Municipal self-government, bereft of its political significance,
restricted to the sphere of local interests and ambitions,
is apt to degenerate into corrupt and spendthrift practices.’<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> To
the curial, as he carried out the commands of the emperor, it
must have been difficult to see any inspiring meaning in it all,
when Gaul was day by day being more abandoned to the barbaric
invasions, while the burden of taxation remained unalleviated.
And yet it is where a meaning, an ideal, is most clearly seen,
that education has its truest incentive and its most fruitful
results.</p>

<p>Denk appeals to the fact that many Roman slaves could read
and write, to Cato’s requirements of a household slave, and to
Mommsen’s statement that there was much reading and writing
among the lower classes. But (as far as the artisans and free
labourers are concerned) the reference is to republican times
when the guilds were free, and when a fiscal imperial system had
not yet enslaved the people and created the frightful inter-class
rigidity which culminated, to the detriment of education, in the
fourth century. That there were, however, even then, some
‘collegiati’ who attained to higher education is clear from the law
of 370.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> The emperor, in asking the Prefect of Rome for a
report of provincial students, makes an exception of those who
are serving in the public guilds. But we must remember that
these ‘collegiati’ probably belonged to the higher guilds, like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
that of the ‘navicularii’, in which the higher classes had a share,
and were probably picked men. Ritter, in his commentary on
the law, suggests that they were young men who had voluntarily
joined a ‘corpus’ and were allowed to stay longer than usual
because they were doing public work. However this may be,
they were certainly the exceptions. The impression derived from
the Theodosian Code is that the ‘collegiati’ who had the opportunity
of higher education were very much the fortunate few.</p>

<p>As for the slaves, it is true that there were some of them in
the fourth century who could read and write like Ausonius’s
‘notarius’, but slaves <i>qua</i> slaves received no education. It was
found useful to make them acquire a knack like shorthand, just
as it is useful to break in a horse. Their knack was their only
virtue. But there was no provision for them as a class, and no
encouragement to extend their knowledge beyond their narrow
speciality. A glance at the laws of the Theodosian Code is
sufficient to show this. A ‘colonus’ is bound to the soil on
which he is born, and if he runs away from the place of his birth
he is to be brought back immediately, together with his family.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>
So says a law of <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 419. A law of Constantine had also
enacted that ‘coloni’, who purposed flight, should be reduced
to slavery and put in chains, and with this sentence upon them
be compelled, as they deserve, to perform the tasks of free men.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>
The law shows that the ‘coloni’ were still regarded as belonging
to the third rather than the fourth class. But their freedom did
not exist in more than name, and it seems most improbable that
they had any share in the education of the day.</p>

<p>Finally, the deduction of Lavisse that education was general
from the fact that the sergeants could read, and that the sons of
veterans had schools, is not altogether justified. For, again, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
soldier would pick up just the minimum of school knowledge to
help him through (and this he might conceivably have done even
without going to a ‘litterator’) more especially as the army by
this time consisted largely of barbarians. As for the veterans,
they were a privileged class, as the thirteen enactments of the
Theodosian Code<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> regarding their status and immunity from
public burdens can prove.</p>

<p>Turning now to the contemporary writers, we can trace the
effect of the code on their methods and ideas. Sidonius clearly
thinks of men in ‘ordines’. At the feast of St. Just, in which
all classes participate, there is not much trace of intermingling
or exchange of greetings, and when they scatter for relaxation
the lines of demarcation are still plain.<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Eumenius, too, illustrates
the value which men attached to class privileges. He had
been ‘magister sacrae memoriae’, and the emperor, in appointing
him to the school at Autun, assures him that his ‘dignitas’ will
not be impaired by the change. The gratitude of Eumenius for
this boon, ‘ut salvo honoris mei privilegio doceam’,<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> is effusive
and significant.</p>

<p>But the important point is that the upper classes came to look
on education as their monopoly. Sidonius rebukes a friend who
is absorbed in the material concerns of his estate for neglecting
his reading.<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> It is a nobleman’s business, he finely says, to
maintain a noble level of culture. Think of the disgrace of
being distanced in your old age by one of humbler rank, and
surpassed in honours by men whose worth is that of a lower
class—‘cum eos, <i>quos esset indignum si vestigia nostra sequerentur</i>,
videris dolens antecessisse’. The argument is that the nobleman
has to undertake administrative and other imperial offices; they
are his by right. Therefore he must keep up his education,
which is the road to office, and also peculiarly his prerogative.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>
And so, when Ausonius says: ‘It isn’t right that I, a royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
master, should expound verses to the common herd’,<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> there is
a background of fact to his jocularity. At the end of the
empire, when the social fabric was tottering and the accustomed
ranks and distinctions were vanishing away (<i>iam remotis gradibus
dignitatum</i>), Sidonius sees in literary knowledge the only mark of
nobility that will survive: ‘solum posthac nobilitatis indicium
litteras nosse.’<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p>In these circumstances it is hard to see how Jullian is justified
in calling the Roman society in Gaul during the fourth century
‘toute intellectuelle’.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> Yet there are two considerations which
must modify our conclusion. The first is that in practice the
lines of demarcation were not so rigid as in theory. As we have
seen in the case of the ‘collegiati’, there was higher education
where we should not have expected it, and members of guilds
were not always swallowed up in their guild work. The second
consideration is that their interest in education was not always
damped by discouraging surroundings. There was a strong and
almost passionate loyalty to letters among the upper classes
which must have spread lower down in society. The curial, no
doubt, sometimes cultivated his intellect as well as land and
tax-collecting, even though there was no material gain to be
won. And it was felt, perhaps, that it was the respectable
thing to send one’s son to a grammar school.</p>

<p>We must, therefore, allow a certain margin for higher education
among the ‘curiales’ and the ‘corporati’, while we accept
a very wide range of mere literacy,<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> such as could be obtained
from an elementary school teacher. The enormous staff of scribes
required for the imperial ‘scholae’ must have embraced many of
a lower social standing. The need for people who could read<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
and write was great, and we may perhaps see in the large<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> number
of grammarians<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> (as compared with the rhetoricians), which the
emperors provided, an indication of this need. But, as we go
down the social scale, it is only the exceptions who go beyond
the grammarian, while the majority probably knew none but the
elementary master.</p>

<h4>(iii) <span class="smcap">The Teacher in Society</span></h4>

<p>Libanius draws a picture of the rhetor lingering in the classroom
after the day’s work because of the unpleasantness of
conjugal and family difficulties at home;<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> and Ausonius roundly
declares, emphasizing another side of the teacher’s unfortunate
lot, that a grammarian is <i>not</i> happy and never was; that the
very name of grammarian is incompatible with happiness. If
beyond destiny and fate there has existed one that was happy,
he must indeed have passed beyond the bounds of the mere
grammarian.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></p>

<p>Routine produced its usual discontent, and it was true of the
fourth century as of the first:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Occidit miseros crambe repetita magistros.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet the striking thing about the Gallic teachers (if we may
take Bordeaux as typical of the province) was their sociability.
Alethius is ‘comis’ and ‘liberalis’;<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> Luciolus is commended by
the poet for his geniality to his guests, his good temper to his
clients, his gentleness with his servants;<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> and to Minervius<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>
he says: ‘No gall embitters your heart; your wit is abundant;
yet your jokes are never such as lead to strife.’<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>They loved their dinners and their jokes, and could jest
without malice and in gentleness of spirit. So Nepotianus is
addressed as a man ‘old in years yet witty and young in heart;
a spirit unembittered and overflowing with much sweetness’.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<p>Leontius earns the cognomen Lascivus,<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> and Jucundus, though
condemned for inefficiency, is admitted to the ‘numerus grammaticorum’
on account of his social and personal pleasantness.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>
It may be noticed, too, that Constantius, in appointing Eumenius
to the head-mastership of the Maeniana, stated as one of his
qualifications ‘his pleasing ways’.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> Wine played a great part
among them. Crispus, the old master of Ausonius, was believed
to have tippled occasionally.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> To the reader Ausonius says in his
introduction to <i>Bissula</i> that he is to be read only by those who
have dined and dined well:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ieiunis nil scribo; meum post pocula si quis</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">legerit, hic sapiet.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>About the futile <i>Griphus</i> he declares that all serious judgement
must be suspended, for ‘iniurium est de poeta male sobrio
lectorem abstemium iudicare’,<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> and the convivial spirit is further
illustrated by the epistles to Paulus<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> and to Theon.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Moreover,
a favourite ideal among these professors was to marry an heiress.
Like Dynamius, who found fortune and a wife as a teacher,<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> the
jovial Marcellus won the goodwill and the daughter of a nobleman,<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>
as did the rhetor Alethius Minervius.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> Even the Syracusan
Citarius ‘soon attained to wedlock in a rich and noble family’.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p>The Theodosian Code clearly shows how eager the emperors
of this time were to increase the social status of the teacher.
A law of 425, for example,<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> raises certain ‘grammatici’ and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
‘sofistae’ to the rank of <i>comes</i>, and adds that all such teachers, if
they behaved well and showed skill in their profession, would
enjoy the same privileges after twenty years of diligent service.</p>

<p>In the social world, therefore, these teachers ranked high: in
the intellectual world their place was considerably lower. We
find that there was a certain standard set for a teacher:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Posset insertus numero ut videri</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">grammaticorum.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jucundus<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> is reproached for not reaching this standard and
being unworthy of his profession. But there can be no doubt
that the requirements were fairly low and very irregularly
fulfilled. Leontius knew only the little that his poor position
demanded,<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> and masters like Ammonius and Anastasius were
equally ignorant.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Ausonius twits Auxilius on his defective
pronunciation and addresses him as ‘inscite magister’,<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> and
Rufus, the rhetorician, had so little sense (<i>cor</i>) that he used to
write ‘reminis<i>co</i>’ in his verses. Moreover, he was very like
a statue in his lifelessness—only softer and more effeminate.<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
Philomusus, again, had stuffed his library full of books, but this
was his only claim to knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>Jung<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> finds an illustration of the general tendency to superficiality
in the fact that many of the Bordeaux professors were
at the same time advocates, poets, and farmers.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> But we feel
that this is carping criticism, and that such combinations of
activity are no more anomalous or indicative of shallowness than
they are in many universities of to-day.</p>

<p>But, on the whole, we get the impression that Julian’s emphasis
on the preparation of teachers,<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> apart from its motive, was much
needed throughout this period, and that the level of the Gallic
university was probably not much above that of a modern high
school.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>In the professional world the status of the teacher had steadily
risen, ever since Vespasian had given education the imperial
blessing by appointing Quintilian to the first State-paid chair.
We find Constantius, in his letter to Eumenius, deprecating the
idea that the teachers’ task is a lower form of imperial service;<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>
and there can be no doubt that Gaul in the fourth and fifth
centuries, all enthusiastic as she was for literature and culture,
honoured her teachers more than had previously been the custom.
With the full light of imperial favour upon them, they were
respected, not so much for what they were, but for all the golden
avenues of imperial office to which their profession could lead.</p>

<p>The picture which Ausonius gives of the Bordeaux professors
suggests a resemblance to Oxford. The division of studies
between the grammarian and the rhetor gives an ‘institutio’
which is the forerunner of the Oxonian School of Classics. For
the grammarian did ‘Mods.’ work, training the pupil in a wide
range of detailed facts, while the rhetorician aimed (though in
a poor way) at a philosophic combination of the facts into
a speech, and at grace and lucidity of style. And this is largely
also the aim of ‘Greats’.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is a similarity of social atmosphere. There is
a bright and genial contact of man with man, which implies
a study of men as well as of books, and there is that emotional
content springing from such intercourse, which, if kept within
bounds, serves to keep thought fresh and balanced, and prevents
the letter from killing the spirit. That there was also the
danger, as at Oxford, of the social side looming too large, is clear
from a study of these professorial portraits.</p>

<h4>(iv) <span class="smcap">Imperial Protection</span></h4>

<p>A change had come over the administration of schools in the
later part of the empire. In early republican times there had
been no public interference with education: the ideal of men like
Cato was ‘in gremio matris educari’.<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> But even the spirit of
Cato could not stop Crates of Mallos from establishing the first
school of grammar, after the Punic Wars had opened the flood-gates
of Greek influence; nor could it prevent fathers from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
paying large sums for the services of these public teachers.
A transition stage came in the first century, when the conflict
between the old and the new reached a crisis. The censors grew
alarmed, and issued a decree in 92 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> prohibiting the teaching
of the Latin rhetoricians as being contrary to the ‘mos maiorum’.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
They had endured Greek rhetoricians, but when Romans began
to adopt the ways of these ‘Graeculi’ they thought it was time
to interfere.<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> But public schools were rapidly growing, and
when Vespasian fixed the salaries of teachers the old conservative
Roman prejudice against public education had practically died
out. In the second century Hadrian opened his Athenaeum—the
first school for higher education. Alexander Severus gave
salaries to teachers ‘etiam in provinciis’.<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

<p>The goodwill and personal interest of the emperors in the
schools is seen in the letter of Constantius to Eumenius.<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> ‘Our
loyal Gauls’, he says, ‘who enjoy the benefits of civilization in
Autun, deserve that we should take thought for the development
of their children’s talents. What gift, then, more fitting than
that which fortune can neither give nor take away? Therefore,
we appoint you to be head of this school; for we have learned to
know from your service under us, your eloquence and your genial
temper.’</p>

<p>Nor was this mere wordy benevolence. Public works, temples,
schools had been repaired.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> Augustodunum had suffered badly
from the inroads of the barbarians, but so effective was the help
given, that the restored city, says the orator, possibly with some
exaggeration, was greater and grander than the old one (<i>ipsa
moles restitutionis immanior</i>). Money was given for private as
well as public buildings, and not only money, but artificers from
over the sea, new inhabitants of high rank, and soldiers to guard
them during the winter.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> All this had a very real bearing on
education. Like Britain, the city had gradually got rid of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
‘barbarism’, and had emerged into the light of Roman culture.<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>
Amid all the benefits of the emperors, says Eumenius, the greatest
is their zeal in fostering liberal studies. Though the cares of
state are great and engrossing, they find time to attend to
education, and herein perhaps the true future of Rome may lie—‘si
non potentia, sed etiam eloquentia Romana revirescat’.<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p>The Theodosian Code shows how Constantine continued and
developed this patronage of education. Gaul appeared prominently
in this connexion with the promulgation of the Law
of Gratian and Valentinian in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 376 for the regulation of
teachers’ salaries, addressed to the prefect of the Gauls.</p>

<p>In this, as in many other laws, it is clear that the imperial
policy aimed at the spread of education. ‘In the most populous,
powerful and famous cities of every district entrusted to your
Magnificence, let all the best teachers be appointed for the
education of the young: we refer to Greek and Latin rhetoricians
and grammarians.’<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> Similarly, Valentinian and Valens had
exhorted any one who was qualified, either to open a new school
or to revive an old one.<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> But the emperors were not content
with a general policy for education. They provided directly for
all the details of a student’s behaviour and discipline. Those
Gallic students who went to Rome for the study of law had to
submit to the enactment of 370,<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> which prescribed many regulations
for their studies and their conduct.</p>

<p>A different and a closer interest in the schools had been
shown by Julian—the interest of a philosopher. He had laid
stress on the morals and efficiency, and on the personal share he
desired to have in the appointment of teachers, probably with
a view to ejecting Christians.</p>

<p>‘Masters and teachers must show excellence first, in character,
and then, in eloquence. But, since I cannot be present in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
person at every city, I command that all who wish to teach
should not rashly and hastily leap into this profession, but only
when their order has judged them fit and the unanimous vote
of the best citizens has gained them a decree of the curials.
This decree will be referred to me for consideration, so that the
teachers may approach their work of public education with the
higher honour of our approval.’<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> This moral emphasis is
repeated in a decree of Valentinian and Valens: ‘si qui
erudiendis adulescentibus <i>vita pariter et facundia idoneus erit</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p>From pupil to teacher, from teacher to civil servant or imperial
dignitary, the emperor’s influence was paramount. He decreed
when studies must cease, and how they must be conducted; it
was he who fostered the schools, and from him needy children
received financial support. The institution of the ‘alimenta’ is
said to be as old as Ptolemy, the founder of the Alexandrian
library;<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> and we read that Nerva, like Augustus,<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> reared
children at the public expense,<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> and that Trajan (as is proved
by two famous inscriptions)<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> and Hadrian followed his example.<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
These ‘alimenta’, which had originally been instituted as a
measure against the decreasing birth-rate, were fully organized
in the early empire, but dwindled as financial difficulties grew.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
Yet we find Constantine passing laws about the support of
children which probably remained in force at least until the end
of the fourth century. ‘Officium tuum’ is his mandate to the
Praetorian Prefect, ‘haec cura praestringat ut si quis parens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
adferat subolem, quam pro paupertate educare non possit, nec in
alimentis nec in veste impertienda tardetur ... ad quam rem et
fiscum nostrum et rem privatam indiscreta iussimus praebere
obsequia.’<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> Again, in 322, there is a similar law, this time
specially intended for provincials: ‘Quiquis igitur huiusmodi
reperietur qui nulla rei familiaris substantia fultus est, quique
liberos suos aegre ac difficile sustentet, per fiscum nostrum ...
stipem necessariam largiantur....’<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> As far as actual schooling
is concerned, this kind of imperial support, being intended
for the relief of the lower classes, applied only to elementary
education.</p>

<p>The teacher was dependent on the emperor (as we have
seen) for his appointment. Sometimes a man would be
directly appointed by the emperor, as Eumenius was,<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> but
generally in Gaul, as at Antioch,<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> he would be nominated by
his municipality, and his nomination would be subject to the
approval of the imperial patron,<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> to whom he looked for all good
things. The Gaul of Panegyric VI speaks of ‘privatorum
studiorum ignobiles curae’, and the suggestion is that it is the
approving glance of the emperor that makes them ‘nobiles’.
Eumenius clearly brings out this relation between the teachers
and the emperors, who are praised because they found time to
appoint schoolmasters as well as masters of the horse.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>And finally, both teacher and student depended on the
emperor for promotion. Imperial service was the conscious
motive of education, and the rhetor could count among the
officials of the empire many a former pupil. One of the panegyrists
looks proudly and wistfully back to those who left his
school and rose high in the forum or the offices of the palace,
and fondly thinks of them as his children. ‘For many and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
ignoble are the streams that take their course from me,’ he
exclaims to the emperor, ‘many whom I guided have risen to
govern thy provinces.’<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> The reason why the emperors take so
much care to appoint efficient teachers is, ‘lest those who ought
to be appointed to the various forms of State service should be
overtaken, as it were, by a sudden cloud midway on the waves
of youth, and steer their course by doubtful stars of oratory.’<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
The service of the emperor is so obviously the best, that anything
else looks like partial shipwreck. The imperial goal
dominates everything. Ausonius served, like many of the
Bordeaux teachers, on the municipality of his town, and rose to
be consul and prefect. Even a man like Exsuperius, whom
Ausonius criticizes as a trivial talker,<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> could become governor
of a province. So much was a public career the fashion that
Ausonius expresses surprise at Alcimus for keeping out of the
imperial service:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Quod laude clarus, quod operatus litteris,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">omnem refugisti ambitum.<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All this finds its counterpart, of course, in the direct encouragement
of the emperors. If Constantine had merely said: ‘We
allow teachers to stand for office, if they wish, but do not compel
them,’<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> Constantius, with an enthusiasm for letters rarely
paralleled among princes, could promise that he would promote
to higher rank him who by his studies and eloquence seemed to
be worthy of the first place. ‘For literature must not be denied
her rewards—literature which is <i>the greatest of all virtues</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>One of the main features of the imperial policy towards the
teachers was the panegyric. The emperors had to mould public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
opinion, and, not possessing newspapers, they fell back on the
professor. And perhaps this is the reason why, during the
fourth century, they made such a special point of residing in
Gaul and expressing their fondness for her by word and deed—Gaul
the home of rhetoricians. However that may be, the
panegyric obtained a regular place among the teacher’s duties.</p>

<p>Ever since Pliny had set the fashion with his panegyric on
Trajan, ‘there had gradually grown up a custom, especially in
the cities of Gaul, where rhetorical studies were flourishing,
a custom which became frequent in the times of Diocletian and
Maximian, and again under Constantine and Constantius, of
sending rhetors to the emperor to congratulate him on successes
and to thank him for benefits.’<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> The panegyric was one of the
accomplishments of the famous Minervius,<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> and among the
‘Panegyrici Latini’ it was a much-coveted honour to be allowed
to air this accomplishment. ‘Summam votorum meorum’<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> is
the description applied by the sixth panegyrist to his speech
before the emperor. Nor need we consider this mere flattery;
for the rewards were many and substantial. Sidonius’s panegyric
on Avitus procured him a statue in the forum of Trajan,<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> after
his panegyric on Majorian (who had been nominated by Avitus’s
murderer Ricimer), he was admitted into the court and became
a count, and when he performed the same service for Anthemius
in 468 he was made prefect of Rome and president of the
Senate; he tells us himself that he obtained the praefecture ‘sub
ope Christi, styli occasione’.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<p>These were the rewards of the brilliant. But even the
humblest grammarian enjoyed the emperor’s favour as a potential
panegyrist. Many laws at different times protected him
from taxes and military service. Constantine had decreed this,
and had added that they were also to be free from prosecution
and shielded from wrongdoing. The magistrates were to exact
a fine of £1,000 from any one who injured them, or themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
bear the punishment.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> In the case of a slave whipping was
prescribed. In 333 Constantine confirmed this law ‘to facilitate
and extend the teaching of liberal arts and studies’.<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> His
example was followed in 414 by Honorius and Theodosius, who
decreed that grammarians, orators, and teachers of philosophy
as well as certain court doctors, besides all the privileges granted
to them by the emperors in the past, should enjoy freedom from the
rearrangement, municipal or curial, of property which had been
put together from several sources in order to be divided equally
(<i>conlatio</i>), from the marking out of land for the senatorial or land
tax (<i>descriptio</i>), and from all office and public burdens. Nor
were they to have soldiers or judges billeted on them wherever
they lived. Moreover, all these privileges were to be shared by
their sons and wives, so that their children could not be forced
to serve in the army.<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>But the gratitude of the Gallic teachers to the emperor was
based on more than personal benefits. They realized very clearly
(in the fourth century, at any rate) that without the Roman
military power education could not have flourished. Eumenius
tells how, after the confusion of destroying barbarians, the trees
flourish again and the corn-stalks lift their heads when the
frontier is made secure. The age of gold has come again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
‘Adeo, ut res est, aurea illa saecula, quae non diu quondam
Saturno rege viguerunt, nunc aeternis auspiciis Iovis et Herculis
renascuntur.’<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> Panegyric inspires comforting pictures, but in
this case there is a basis of truth. There is a true ring about
the praises of the Aeduan who describes the evil condition of his
country, and pours out his thanks before the emperor,<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> even
though he has a tendency to hysterics.<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> There is a certain
amount of real feeling in his exclamation: ‘O divinam, imperator,
tuam in sananda civitate medicinam’;<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> and the Gallic
orator of the sixth panegyric is not very far wrong when he
says: ‘Thence, O emperor, comes this peace which we enjoy:
not the waters of the Rhine, but the terror which thy name
inspires is the rampart that defends us.’</p>

<p>Valentinian I, ‘the frontier emperor’, restored the defences of
the West against the barbarians (367-8). Trouble was brewing
among the Persians,<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> says Ammianus, ‘but Valentinian, conceiving
in his mind great things and profitable’, fortified the
whole of the Rhine from Rhaetia to the sea, strengthened camps
and forts, planted many towers in suitable spots along the Gallic
frontier, and sometimes even across the river close to barbarian
territory.<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> Zosimus remarks on his care for the provinces and
for the Celtic peoples.<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>Even the usurper Constantine, ‘the vain deliverer of Gaul’,
as Gibbon calls him, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 407 ἐγκατέστησε ... καὶ τῷ
Ῥήνῳ πᾶσαν ἀσφάλειαν, ἐκ τῶν Ἰουλιανοῦ βασιλέως χρόνων
ῥᾳθυμηθεῖσαν.<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>One of the panegyrists<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> mentions ‘sapientia’ as a blessing of
the empire, ‘ipsa ... illa quae videtur rerum omnium domina
esse’, and this wisdom comes by experience of men and things,
‘perspectis hominum moribus et exploratis rerum eventis’. By
giving opportunities to the Gauls for studying and mixing with
different types from all parts of the world, Roman rule contributed
to the general culture of the country; and the provincial
orator is not guilty of his usual exaggeration when he emphasizes
the fact that in this way, too, the empire was a boon at this time
to the education of Gaul.</p>

<p>But against these real and undeniable advantages there may
be set some corresponding drawbacks. Elaborate centralization<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>
may be good from a purely military point of view, but it checks
the progress of the human spirit. The panegyrists show how
excessive the expenditure of the central court was, and how the
interests of the empire were sacrificed to the sovereign.<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> The
accession of Julian was a boon, for ‘the provinces were exhausted,
partly by the plundering barbarians, partly by the greed,
destructive as it was disgraceful, of the provincial governors.’<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>
And of Julian the orator asks in a way which affirms the charge
on the part of his enemy Constantius: ‘Flagitiis administrantium
non modo frena laxaret, sed etiam stimulator accederet...?’</p>

<p>This over-centralization resulted in over-interference in education.
‘The traditional liberty which had formed the foundation
of Roman education was seriously infringed by the appearance of
imperial privileges.... All these benefactions were in reality
an interference in the affairs of education.... Thus from the
second to the fourth centuries of our era, the complete transformation
of school organization was quietly accomplished. It is
the transition period between the ancient Roman school and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
formalism of the Middle Ages.’<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> This stiffening of the imperial
support into formalism and tyranny is seen in the Theodosian
Code. The personal liberty of the teacher becomes more and
more restricted. Theodosius and Valentinian decreed<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> in 425
that no State teachers, on pain of being driven from the city with
the stigma of ‘infamia’, were to hold classes in public outside
the prescribed limits. Tutors in private families were permitted
if they confined their teaching to the inmates of the house. But
all who taught in the emperor’s Capitoline ‘auditorium’ were
strictly forbidden to teach privately or else they must lose all
the privileges of their office.</p>

<p>It looks as if this prohibition of all public schools outside the
imperial academy was directed against the itinerant sophists.
The law was issued at Constantinople and it may have been
a salutary measure in some ways; but there is a suspicion that
the emperor is rather abusing his authority to favour his own
particular college, and the principle of vesting such unlimited
powers over education in one man is a dangerous one. The
penalty imposed on those who disobey this injunction (<i>infamia</i>
and banishment) seems to be disproportionately severe. It
smacks of that rigidity which made the emperor forbid the
masters of his academy (<i>intra Capitolii auditorium</i>) to teach, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
privately, elsewhere. And it is a continuation of that coercive
attitude on the part of the imperial patron towards the schools,
which we see increasing from the beginning of our period when
Julian enacted that every teacher must receive the imperial
approval before he was qualified to teach.<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> He was right in
insisting on efficiency, but his evident attempt to abolish private
adventure schools can hardly be justified.</p>

<p>Extreme centralization had also another and subtler influence.
We feel, as we read the words of Eumenius or Ausonius to the
emperors, that there was an unhealthy relation between them,
one which tended to destroy the individuality of the subject.
The deification of the emperor looms very large in the <i>Panegyrici</i>:<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
his favour was the summit of a man’s ambitions, to him all ideas
and ideals had to be accommodated. It is quite pitiful to watch
the hysterics of the panegyrists. It is no more a case merely of
the rules of rhetoric and the laws of the game; it is the complete
breakdown of all self-respect and individuality, an abasement of
body and soul before the temporal powers, springing partly from
the rhetorical tradition and partly from a real sense of dependence
on the emperor.</p>

<p>‘O that fortunate journey of mine!’ exclaims one of the
panegyrists of his visit to the emperor at Rome, ‘O labour
excellently begun and ended! What blessings do I taste of!
With what joys am I furnished! What wonders will I dispense
when I return to the cities of the Gauls! What numbers of
thunderstruck people around me, what huge audiences will
listen to me when I say: “Rome I have seen, Theodosius I have
seen, and both together have I looked on. I have seen him, the
father of the prince, I have seen him, the prince’s avenger, him,
the restorer of the prince.”’<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> Such is the recurrent language
of a distinguished man, Pacatus the Gaul, a friend of Ausonius,
who dedicated to him the <i>Ludus Septem Sapientum</i> and the
<i>Technopaegnion</i>, and said of him that none, save Vergil, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
better loved by the Muses.<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> Nazarius, who may be one of
Ausonius’s professors,<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> solemnly maintains that it is wicked to
form an opinion about the emperors, and reasons out his thin-spun
absurdities thus: ‘Nam et in vestibulo suo inquirentem
repellit obiecta veneratio, et si qui mentem propius adierunt,
quod oculis in solem se contendentibus evenit, praestricta acie,
videndi facultate caruerunt.’<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> The splendour of majesty (it is
a golden glitter) affects the eyesight of the orator. Ausonius
had been asked by the emperor to write a poem. ‘I have no
talent for it: but Caesar has commanded: I will have. It isn’t
<i>safe</i> to refuse a god.’<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> He speaks with great glee of his escape,
in attaining to the consulship, from all the usual methods of
candidature: all was summed up in Caesar ‘Romanus populus,
Martius campus, equester ordo, rostra, ovilia, senatus, curia—unus
mihi omnia Gratianus’.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> The ease implied in the simplification
of everything to the person of the emperor was no
doubt pleasant: but it was a mark of decadence. It meant
a limitation of ideas, a cramping of individuality, a slavishness
of spirit which must eventually reduce education to spiritless
formalism. What perverted results this militaristic control of
education sometimes could produce is well illustrated by the
<i>Cento Nuptialis</i>. Ausonius had enough education and taste to
be half ashamed of his subject. ‘Piget enim Vergiliani carminis
dignitatem tam ioculari dehonestasse materia.’ Yet what
was he to do? ‘Iussum erat.’ Valentinian had commanded it:
‘sanctus imperator ... vir meo iudicio eruditus’. If we are to
judge of this erudition by such fruits as these, we cannot say
much for its depth or taste. ‘Ridere, nil ultra expeto’, says the
poet. But there is more than one way of laughing, as he very
well knew. Here, then, we have imperial interference making
a man at the head of his profession, a man who would be
imitated by his pupils and by other teachers as he imitated the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
emperor, write for the edification of the world the most asinine
and disgusting verses ever produced.</p>

<p>Not only the personal, but also the collective individuality,
tended to be impaired by over-centralization. The sense of citizenship,
which it is one of the duties of education to foster, was
crushed in the great mechanical organization of the Empire.
Loyalty to Rome grew hollow for lack of a subordinate and more
immediate loyalty. Loyalty is in the first place evoked by
personal contact, and the emperor was sometimes very far away.
The subordinate official lost the full sense of partnership because
some mighty power from without imposed laws and made regulations,
and could interfere between him and his superior official at
any moment. Even in men like Ausonius, who could get into
touch with the emperor and feel genuine loyalty towards him by
reason of a sense of partnership and personal benefits, we find
Rome appearing as the symbol of the Empire in a very official
capacity. In his description of noble cities he gives one perfunctory
line to Rome and forty to Bordeaux. ‘Bordeaux has my
love, Rome my respect’,<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> he says, and he gives the reason: ‘<i>here</i>
stood my cradle, <i>there</i> my chair of office.’ Officialdom may
evoke respect, but it can never call forth that spirit of love which
is the basis of true loyalty in every sphere. Paulinus of Pella,
writing after the barbarian invasions of the early fifth century,
expresses himself in a similar way. Rome is only cursorily
mentioned<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> in conventional terms,<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> and there is no point at
which Rome touches him personally. Indeed, he has rather
bitter memories of her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Romanumque nefas contra omnia iura licenter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in mea grassatum diverso tempore damna.<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Bordeaux, on the other hand, is described in the language of
affection.<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>If Rome and her rule appeared so artificial even to the upper
class of society, much greater must have been the effect on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
less privileged and enlightened. There is evidence that the law
providing immunity from public burdens in the case of teachers
was frequently abused. So little public spirit and sense of
citizenship was there that men falsely assumed the philosopher’s
cloak to escape serving their city. Against this a law of
Valentinian and Valens<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 369) protests. ‘Let every man
be returned to his country who is known to assume the philosopher’s
cloak illegitimately and insolently ... for it is disgraceful’
(does a ripple of humour momentarily penetrate the
rigid face of Roman law?), ‘it is disgraceful that he who professes
ability to bear even the blows of fortune, should shrink from the
burdens of his country.’<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> The general feeling of citizenship,
when we look beneath the rhetorical veneer, was unquestionably
low; and it is only rarely that we find a man like Eumenius
who really had the ‘amor reipublicae’<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> which issued in action,
and the enthusiasm of a Sidonius for the Empire could hardly
have been shared by the less privileged classes who had had
fewer opportunities of enjoying Rome’s benefits, and had suffered
so much more from her failure to protect them against the
barbarian or the corrupt official.</p>

<p>Monroe, speaking of the imperial support of education, says:
‘This is probably but another evidence of the general decline in
virility and morality, for it is in order to combat these tendencies
that education is encouraged.’<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<p>Now there were elements of decline in the education of the
day, but the emperors did not see them. If they had, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
would have changed, not merely increased, the schools. If it
was virility they wanted to restore, they would not have encouraged
the panegyrists; if morality, they would hardly have
expected teachers to write things like the <i>Cento Nuptialis</i>, and
there would have been more of them who, like Julian, mentioned
such an aim in their educational decrees. Much truer it would
be to say that the support of education was due partly to a real
enthusiasm for letters,<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> and partly to that policy which sought
to gain the goodwill of the provincial youth, at a time when
the provinces were becoming more and more important. And
in education lay the key to the deeper Romanization of Gaul.</p>

<p>About the general sincerity of the emperors in passing their
educational laws there can be no doubt. Jung thinks that these
magnificent and munificent decrees were not always sincerely
meant or carried out, ‘et multa interesse, ut Romani aiebant,
inter os atque offam’.<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> But the concrete fact of the help given
to Autun, and the general correspondence between the historical
events and the school conditions as recorded in Ausonius and
elsewhere, suggest that the suspicion is on the whole unjustified.
The slackness in paying salaries, which he quotes, was one of
the abuses to which the emperors specially addressed themselves,
and Ausonius’s epigram about the happiness of the grammarian,<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>
to which he refers, is no proof whatsoever. For it does not
imply broken promises, and happiness may be impaired by
causes independent of imperial laws.</p>

<span class="smaller">CHRISTIAN EDUCATION</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Introductory: Church and State</span></h3>

<p>We have seen how large the emperors loomed in the ideas and
education of the fourth century, and what some of the evil
effects of this were. As we pass into the fifth century we find
a growing reaction. The balance is shifted, and the Church
begins to receive from the emperors an authority which had
previously been confined to the secular State.</p>

<p>At first the Church had been independent, unnoticed by the
State; then, after the persecutions of the early Empire, it found
imperial recognition with the accession of Constantine. But
there was still a measure of independence of the State: the
emperors did not interfere with Church dogma, and the bishops
took no part in politics. They were, as yet, very humble and
submissive, for they felt the need of imperial protection, having
no sufficient organization of their own and no effective ecclesiastical
government; though a considerable machinery had been
created by the councils which had been meeting since the third
century.</p>

<p>A third stage is reached when the bishops become haughty
and imperious and begin to meddle with politics. The clergy
have strengthened themselves by organization and training.
The latent antagonism between Church and State becomes
prominent, and the State sometimes comes off worse. And when
the political framework goes under, the power of the Church
grows and prospers.<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></p>

<p>Now it is this growth of Church influence in the fifth century<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
and its effect upon ideas and ideals that is important for our
purpose. On the material side this growth is indicated by an
increase of civil power. The Edict of Milan restored the confiscated
buildings of the churches, and Constantine in 321<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>
allowed the clergy to receive bequests. A vast amount of
property was bequeathed to the Church in the fifth century, the
administration of which was settled by the canons of the various
synods. These canons gave rise to an ecclesiastical law which
was later augmented by the decisions of the Popes, and played
a great part in the Middle Ages. Civil jurisdiction largely
passed into the hands of the bishops, and against their sentence,
which was carried out by the civil authorities, there was no
appeal. The entire administration of the widespread Church
property and affairs was in the hands of the bishop. The State
reserved criminal law for itself. Like the pagan ‘flamen’, the
bishop sat on the ‘Curia’ of his city, where he exercised great
authority.</p>

<p>More and more the State came to recognize the ecclesiastical
society as a separate polity. Manumissions within the Church
were sanctioned by the emperors.<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> The clergy are repeatedly
excused from all public burdens whatsoever.<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> This cleavage
between Church and State, which had been momentarily accentuated
by Julian’s law of 362 forbidding Christians to teach,
is further emphasized by the establishment of separate courts
for ecclesiastical offenders. ‘The clergy’ (so ran the law of
Honorius and Theodosius in 412) ‘may be tried only before an
episcopal court.’<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>More and more, therefore, the bishop came to be appealed to
as a civil power,<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> and when the crisis came bishops like Sidonius
defended the towns against the invaders.<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> A sense of the failing
Empire made men turn to the Church for help against the
oppression of imperial officials, and the ruin of invading
barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Above all they turned to her for education.</p>

<p>For this position the Church had strengthened herself by
increased organization during the fourth and fifth centuries.
She assimilated the principles of imperial government and law,
applied them in creating her bishoprics, and modelled on them
her methods of administration. Thus law, the great contribution
of the Roman Empire, passed into the Church, and so down
the ages.</p>

<p>On the spiritual side this development of Christianity is
marked by a greater kindliness (due also to the teaching of the
pagan philosophers<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>) in the hard Roman world. Hints of
a new attitude to slaves are to be found in the Theodosian Code.
There are lengthy laws providing protection from enslavement—‘non
erit impunita labefactatio atque oppugnatio libertatis’<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>—and
steps are taken to enable people to rise out of slavery by
placing legal means within their reach and making the assertion
of liberty easier.<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> Moreover, the breaking up of slave families
is forbidden, and the objection is stated from the moral point
of view. ‘Quis enim ferat liberos a parentibus, a fratribus
sorores ... segregari? Igitur qui dissociata in ius diversum
mancipia traxerunt, in unum redigere eadem cogantur: ac si cui
propter redintegrationem necessitudinum servi cesserint, vicaria<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
per eum qui eosdem susceperit mancipia reddantur.’<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> But while
we must grant to the philosophers and to Christianity an important
share in the gradual disappearance of slavery, it must
be remembered that the process was largely due to economic
causes. It was found that it paid better to give a man some
measure of personal freedom, and the economists tell us that the
colonate which appeared at the beginning of the third century
was a natural economic development of slavery. The absence of
wars of conquest also contributed to this result.<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, liberation of body and spirit was aimed at by the
attitude of the Church to the stage and the arena. Attendance
was forbidden to Christians, and actors were not allowed to be
baptized. The discredit thus cast upon these professions was
emphasized by the emperors. A great many restrictions were
introduced,<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> and games were forbidden on certain Christian
feast-days.<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> It was enacted that actresses who had become
Christians—‘quas melior vivendi usus vinculo naturalis condicionis
evolvit’—should not be forced back into the profession.<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>
Similarly, actors and actresses who had received the sacrament
when thought to be dying must not be allowed to act again.<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<p>Against the arena, too, a blow was struck. Constantine
enacted in 325 that all those criminals who had previously been
condemned to the arena should now be assigned to the mines.
This did not mean the total abolition of gladiatorial contests,
but it certainly meant a decrease in the victims of the ‘ludi
gladiatorii’, and the moral lead it gave was valuable. ‘Cruenta
spectacula’, he said, ‘in otio civili et domestica quiete non
placent.’<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>Later, he forbade soldiers to become gladiators,<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> and Valentinian
exempted Christians from the punishment of the arena.<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> Gibbon
gives the story of St. Telemachus to mark the final abolition
of these contests by Honorius<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> in 404, though Bury points out
that there is evidence of such shows some years later. As late
as the fourth century we still find a man like Symmachus
spending £80,000 on games for his son’s praetorship,<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> but, on
the whole, the influence of the Christian ideal made for greater
frugality and gentleness.</p>

<p>This influence was also seen in the increase of charities. The
bishops, for example, often distributed corn among the people
when times were bad.<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> That misuse was made of this spirit is
seen from the strict law of Valentinian against mendicancy;<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>
but the misuse is not so serious as the previous lack of charitable
spirit.</p>

<p>The feeling of the Christians against slavery and the manual
labour of the monks tended to destroy the aristocratic prejudice
against practical work, and made for a simpler and more natural
life. The artificial position in which the pagan world had
placed women was to some extent remedied along the same
line of the brotherhood of man. Jerome’s correspondence with
Paula and Eustochium is an indication of this new attitude.<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>
Naturalness also resulted from a reaction against the exaggerated
centralization of the Empire, and was manifested in a development
of individuality. The Western Church occasionally showed that
it could stand up to the emperor.<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> When Constantius commanded
that all the bishops assembled at the synod of Ariminum should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
be given their food (<i>annonae et cellaria</i>) the bishops of Gaul and
Britain refused the gift, fearing the diplomacy of Constantius
because ‘it did not seem fitting. They refused the imperial
support and preferred to live at their own expense.’<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p>There was, therefore, a considerable and increasing independence
on the part of the Church. Yet Church and State co-operated
in many things. One of these points of co-operation,
which was most important for education, was the holding of
councils. First the Council of Arles (314), representing the
Western Church, and then the Council of Nicea (325), representing
the whole Church, was summoned by Constantine. And
the influence of these councils in clearing away provincial
prejudices and producing breadth of vision must have reacted
very favourably on education, though the bishops of Gaul, owing
to the larger extent of their bishoprics, did not have that close
relation of teacher and pupil with their congregations which was
the case in the East.</p>

<p>With all this in her favour the Church drew into her service
men of the best blood and intellect. The nobility became the
holders of the bishoprics, and the Christians consented. Indeed,
they did more than consent. They sometimes demanded it, as
in the case of Ambrose, feeling, no doubt, the value of having
a man of high social rank to protect them in the political world.
Men like Sidonius who had been living quite a ‘worldly’ life
became bishops, moved, one is inclined to suspect, rather by the
sense of power than the spirit of devotion. Thus aristocratic
ideas were introduced into the Church and the bishop’s office was
sometimes made hereditary, as in the case of Eucherius and his
sons Salonius and Veranius. These aristocrats were at the same
time the intellectuals of their time, and men like Lupus, Bishop
of Troyes, who was consulted by all the writers of the South,<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
Arbogast of Trèves, afterwards Bishop of Chartres,<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> of whose
learning, as of that of Auspicius, Sidonius thought much,<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> Patiens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
of Lyons,<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> Faustus of Riez,<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> Mamertus of Vienne,<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Graecus of
Marseilles,<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> Perpetuus of Tours,<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> and many others, all friends
of Sidonius and therefore of culture, shifted the balance of
intellect from the pagan to the Christian side of society.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of these hopeful signs, this growth in the
power of ideals, we feel that the Church in Gaul did not transform
the Roman Empire. Power the Church obtained, but
found it a perilous possession. For with power came the whole
host of political corruptions which had found a home in the
imperial system, and entered, unsuspected, along the paths which
custom had made. In becoming, to some extent, the successor
of the Empire, the Church exposed herself to imperial dangers.
Politics tended to overshadow principles. At least one of the
two invasions of which Montalembert speaks<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> was needed in
order that the Church should save Society—that of the monks
from the South.</p>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Persistence of Rhetoric: Tradition and Reaction</span></h3>

<p>The development of Christianity, then, in the fourth and fifth
centuries, largely takes the form of a struggle between the old
and the new. Everywhere in the ecclesiastical society there are,
inevitably, survivals, and they loom particularly large on account
of two factors: the entry of Roman law into the Church, and
the assumption of Church leadership by large numbers of the
aristocracy.</p>

<p>It is natural, therefore, that we should find survivals in
education too, and the extent to which we find them is evidence
of the strength and the universality of the rhetorical tradition.
And we need to see this tradition in its proper perspective before
we can fully appreciate the significance of Gallic education in
our period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>As we look back on the long line of rhetorical teachers, we
can trace an increasing degree of narrowness and futility. The
conditions of life in the city-state had made public speaking
a practical and personal necessity. What Isocrates strove to do
in his rôle as pamphleteer was to raise oratory from the personal
to the national level, to connect education with statesmanship,<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>
and to unify it by setting before it the ideal of a united Greece.
The sphere of rhetoric in his view was wide and humane.<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> It is
true that he himself was a theorist, unskilled in the practical
issues of politics.<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> He was what Crito in the <i>Euthydemus</i>
called a ‘Boundary Stone’—one who tried to combine practical
politics and philosophy, avoiding the extremes of each. His
attempt was unpopular, though ultimately he succeeded, for his
school became the university of Greece.<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> But the ideal which
he put forward had a real inspiration, and had none of the
cramping restrictions of later rhetoric. Moreover, he taught
the unity of moral and intellectual education: ‘The more
strongly a man desires to persuade his audience’ (the intellectual
practice of the rhetorical school) ‘the more will he train himself
in culture of mind and manners and in gaining the esteem of
his fellow citizens.’<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> Speech is regarded as the instrument of
Persuasion, from which all the blessings of human society
proceed,<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> and its function is to advance civilization by educating
the ignorant and testing the wise.</p>

<p>Such was the high educational ideal of Isocrates, and we
find much of it reflected in Cicero, his admirer and his
imitator. The breadth of view is not impaired. For Cicero
maintains that the power of eloquence is such that it embraces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
the rise, the force, the vicissitudes of all affairs, virtues, and
duties; of everything in nature—character, mind, life. It
defines the moral code, the principles of law and right. It regulates
the State, and on every subject and in all its relations its
words are many and eloquent.<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> There is the same attempt to
connect rhetoric with politics, the same insistence that intellectual
issues (<i>doctrina bene dicendi</i>) cannot be separated from moral ones
(<i>doctrina recte faciendi</i>).<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> Wide and all-round knowledge is
required of the orator: ‘mea quidem sententia, nemo poterit esse
omni laude cumulatus orator, nisi erit omnium rerum magnarum
atque artium scientiam consecutus.’<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> Yet Cicero was a panegyrist,
and he followed the artificial rules of the game in exactly
the same way as the Gallic rhetoricians of the third and fourth
centuries did; and when he warns against spending too much
time on philosophy,<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> which may be lightly learned, he says, we
feel that he is giving rein to a natural Roman tendency to
discount thought, and that this tendency proved the bane of
rhetoric.</p>

<p>Cicero’s attempt to make the oratorical education something
of wide scope, and to make it bear upon practical politics, was
doomed to failure. More and more the tyranny of rhetorical
rules, co-operating with the restriction of liberty under the
Empire, produced a narrow and formal result. The sciolists of
the fourth century believed that philosophy could be so easily
learned that they hardly troubled to make its acquaintance.
A political connexion with oratory was kept up, but it consisted
in the degenerate panegyric. More and more rhetorical education
narrowed its range, and retired within the academical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
atmosphere of the school.<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> As for moral education, we must
find in the criticisms of Tacitus and Juvenal an element of truth.
The emperor set the fashion, and the subject did not always find
an inspiring example.</p>

<p>The change that came over oratory was not entirely one of
artificiality. This there had been in Isocrates, whose rules were
just as artificial as those of the ‘Panegyrici Latini’. It was rather
a question of ideal. Isocrates had a national ideal, which could
give meaning and life to his utterances; Cicero had the interests
of a party to inspire him; but the panegyrists of the fourth
century were confined to the emperor; his birthday or his benefits
are the sort of subjects that stimulate their oratory, and Pliny
could praise with equal fervour the political reforms and the
white horses of Trajan.</p>

<p>Thus the rhetorical tradition, the ideal of oratory as the goal
of education, came down through the centuries to our period.
It came to Gaul, and flourished exceedingly on account of the
natural aptitude of the Gauls for eloquence. Lucian, in the
<i>Herakles</i>,<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> gives a picture of the Gallic Hercules who drags
all men after him by fine chains attached to his tongue and
their ears, and they follow gladly though it is in their power
to break away. Cerialis, in addressing the Treveri and Lingones,
maintained that the Roman way of establishing justice was the
sword, but that words had most influence with the Gauls.<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a></p>

<p>And Jerome said of the Gauls: ‘The fact that they are prolific
of orators points not so much to the studious character of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
country as to the noise made by the rhetors: especially as
Aquitaine boasts of its Greek origin.’<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> This is borne out by
the inscriptions. We are struck in the south by the frequency
of long-winded and ornate epitaphs, e.g.<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a></p>

<p>As we go north epitaphs of this description become much rarer,
which seems to indicate that as the influence of the Celtic
element, and, perhaps, the Greek Massilia, decreases, there is
a decrease also in the ‘ubertas Gallici sermonis’.<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p>We can hardly realize to-day how enormous the power and the
extent of rhetoric was. In all parts of the Empire it was the mark
of a cultured gentleman. As we have seen, it was the basis of
education, the condition of imperial appointments, a tremendous
factor in the policy of the emperors. ‘If we lose our eloquence’,
said Libanius,<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> ‘what will be left to distinguish us from the
barbarians?’ and again, ‘If you know the art of speaking you
know the art of commanding.’<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> From Isocrates to Libanius
Persuasion (Peitho) cast her spell with unfailing charm, nor was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
it Gaul alone that was bound by the chains of the tongue.
Beyond the Graeco-Roman world the influence went: Sidonius,
the conservative, could compliment an Arbogast on his eloquence,<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>
and it was the rhetoric of pagan Gaul, as well as the religion of
Christian Gaul, that led captive her fierce conquerors. So, too,
beyond the pagan world, rhetoric invaded the Church and left
its manifold traces on Christian education.</p>

<p>Kaufmann estimates that by the year 450 pagan schools in
Gaul were disappearing under the influence of the Church
militant.<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> Now it is true that the Church considered it a duty
to condemn the rhetoricians, but their system persisted nevertheless
through the monasteries up to our own day both in the
matter and in method.</p>

<p>The Christian literature of the period shows this clearly. In
poetry (except in a few cases like the <i>Ad uxorem</i>, and the <i>De
providentia Dei</i>) the fetters of the tradition are still strong, and
in trying to force biblical subjects into unsuitable forms, men
like Sedulius, Marius Victor, and Paulinus of Nola produce mere
lifeless paraphrases; in prose, where there were fewer rules to
check naturalness and freshness of thought, the results are much
more gratifying. In the schools it is recognized that the rhetorical
system is indispensable. Tertullian<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> allows Christian children
to attend pagan schools, though he will not permit Christians to
teach in them, and Jerome, while he complains that the clergy
are too fond of Vergil and the Comedies, is constrained to add
‘in pueris necessitatis est’.<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> The Church did not create a new
educational system.</p>

<p>One or two particular cases of the survival of rhetoric may be
given. Ennodius, Bishop of Pavia, born in 474 at Arles, illustrates
in a typical way the enormous power which rhetoric could
exercise over Christians as late as the end of the fifth century.
He is passionately in love with the forms and methods of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
pagan authors, loves their pomp and glitter,<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> and is always
playing a part in the hope of winning applause.<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> He makes
rhetoric say: ‘I am she who does things or changes things done.
Light can dispel the darkness, however vast, in which the law
involves a man, and this light by reading I can give. I am she
from whom men await prosecution if guilty and acquittal if
innocent ... for my gain the Roman keeps vigil throughout
the Empire. Unless I adorn them, office, riches, honours lose
their attraction: it is I who rule the rulers.’<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> This is all very
similar to what Isocrates had said centuries ago, when he talked
of the power and benefits of Persuasion,<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> and the traditional moral
note is there just as in Isocrates<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> and in Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> Rhetoric, says
Ennodius, is the only moulder of public opinion. Her charm is
irresistible and universal. (Why mention so obvious a fact?) The
opinion she creates is eternal. It is she who makes people believe
whatever she wishes about the deeds of the brave, she who
can suppress facts with impunity. She is the mother of poetry,
jurisprudence, dialectic, arithmetic, and she gives them their
value.<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> ‘Grammar’ is recognized as the necessary precedent,
the nurse of knowledge and virtue, who produces the sparks that
lead to the Ciceronian fire of speech.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> The idea that rhetorical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
adornment is specially connected with the school is still current.
A correspondent begs him with many prayers that his letter to him
should be embellished with the graces of the school (<i>multis enim
supplicationibus exegistis ut pagina vobis concinnationis didascalicae
fingeretur</i><a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>) and in the <i>Libellus pro Synodo</i> he urges ‘illas
<i>didascalici</i> libelli relegamus argutias’.<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a></p>

<p>Later on Ennodius began to have misgivings about the part
rhetoric played in his life. ‘Erat orandi fastidium dum perorandi
tenebar cupiditate....’<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> He laments his placid satisfaction with
his fine speeches, his elation at poetic successes, while he had
no ear for the ‘angelorum chori’ owing to the intoxication of
applause. ‘Quotiens adclamantium flatibus propter religionem
vertex nudatus intumuit....’ But even in his confessions
rhetoric is present, and she triumphs at the very time when he
speaks of her defeat.</p>

<p>A curious instance of the survival of rhetoric is seen in the
invective of Hilary of Poitiers against Constantius.<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> The author
has worked up a great deal of feeling, and, to give it the most
effective utterance, he lets it flow into the moulds prescribed by
tradition. His divisions correspond perfectly to those of the
schools. He spares no form of contumely, even at the expense
of historical fact.<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> His railing reminds us of Milton’s denunciation
of Salmasius:<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> for as late as the seventeenth century
Latin retained its reputation as the language of invective. In
spite of his preliminary professions of sincerity: ‘cesset itaque
maledictorum opinio et mendacii suspicio. Veritatis enim ministros<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
decet vera proferre’, we feel that in following the rules of
the game he has proved himself a good player, but not always
‘a servant of truth’.<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p>Of a truer type was the rhetoric of Hilary of Arles. Honoratus
is enthusiastic about the copious eloquence of his oratory,
the gems of expression which he produced, the varied shades and
shapes of his descriptions.<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> There was plenty of rhetorical
colour, but there was also elasticity. ‘If the learned company
was absent, he fed the hearts of the untutored with simple food’;
and it was the opinion of contemporary critics, the savants of
the day, that Hilary ‘had attained something that was neither
eloquence nor learning, something superhuman’.<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> Famous for
eloquence were also Salvian, the master of fiery denunciation,
and Lupus, ‘scholis adhibitus et rhetorum studiis imbutus’.<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> In
the very monasteries the artifices of the rhetor’s school lingered.
Valerian, Bishop of Cemelium (near Nice), gives many examples
of this in his Homilies. He frequently uses Parallelism and
Repetition: ‘Disciplina igitur magistra est religionis, magistra
verae pietatis; quae nec ideo increpat ut laedat, nec ideo castigat
ut noceat’;<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> or Chiasmus and Assonance: ‘Alter de subscriptione
patris disputat: alter de fratris persona desperat’;<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>
‘Vitare ista, dilectissimi, per singulos gradus forte difficile est,
et laboriosum multis simul hostibus per diversos errores occurrere’;
or Alliteration: ‘Ita <i>e</i>st <i>e</i>rgo, ut in te antiqui iuris
districtio nihil habeat potestatis, si ea quae legis <i>p</i>lenitudo <i>p</i>ostulat,
<i>o</i>bedienter <i>o</i>bserves’.<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> ‘Et <i>n</i>ullus <i>p</i>rofecto adhuc <i>p</i>oenae
finis <i>n</i>isi Christus <i>n</i>oster cruentis <i>l</i>egibus o<i>l</i>eum <i>m</i>isericordiae
<i>m</i>iscuisset.’<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> ‘Sic erit ut <i>h</i>omo de <i>h</i>umiliore <i>l</i>oco ad ce<i>l</i>siora
perveniat et remuneratus honore <i>c</i>ondigno, <i>c</i>aelestis gratiam
potestatis adquirat.’<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<p>The rhetorical tradition, therefore, lived on; and it survived
the more easily because of the controversial nature of Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
at this time and the importance of preaching. The change from
the rhetor’s ‘cathedra’ to the pulpit was often merely one of place
and subject: the method was the same. And so the ideal of the
orator persisted. In education it persisted for the further obvious
reason that the monasteries had not yet organized themselves
round the model of St. Benedict, and that very often Christian
parents had to send their children to the pagan schools—in spite
of Tertullian’s warnings.<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></p>

<p>The triumph of rhetoric among the Christians, however, was
only partial. When the Christian Fathers observed their congregations
of simple and unlettered folk, and remembered the
injunction of Christ<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> and the teaching of St. Paul,<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> they began
to feel the need of a more direct style of speech. Largely, too,
it was a natural reaction, springing from the opposition between
Christian and pagan, and the ascetism which the monasteries
preached.</p>

<p>This reaction is noticeable chiefly in the Church Fathers. In
their prefaces it became the customary thing to proclaim their
‘rusticity’, and to hide (sometimes with false modesty) the traces
of their rhetorical training.<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> So much was this the tendency,
that Sidonius, with all his highly refined artificiality, must needs
talk about his ‘countrified style’ (‘Si quid stilo rusticante
peraravero’,<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> ‘in hoc stylo cui non urbanus lepos inest sed pagana
rusticitas’<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>). Partly, of course, this was due to the over-courteous
ways of high society at that time, as we may see from
the correspondence of Symmachus or of Ausonius, and to an idea
(never carried out by these gentlemen) that letter-writing ought
to be careless and natural.<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> But the reaction against rhetoric<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
was very strong. None of the Christian clergy dared to defend
the rhetoricians openly. Lactantius, who did so,<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> was a layman.</p>

<p>The inscriptions reflect this tendency, or at any rate one of
its causes—the simplicity and ignorance of the people. The
Christian epitaphs, though influenced now and then by rhetorical
floridness, as in the case of those composed by Sidonius,<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> are
much shorter and simpler than the pagan ones. Sometimes they
consist merely of a cross with the name of the person.<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> Sometimes
the words ‘pax tecum’ are added. The increase in
Christian education is indicated by the fact that there are only
four inscriptions dating from the fourth century and fifty-four
from the fifth.</p>

<p>How constantly the Church Fathers strove to check the
rhetorical tendency in themselves and in the clergy may be seen
from their frequent protests. Jerome remarked reprovingly of
Hilary of Poitiers that he was affected by the tragic and turgid
vein in the Gallic character, and too much adorned with the
‘flowers of Greece’, so that his long periods were not understood
by the simple friars.<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> And Vincent of Lérins had to warn that
a priest’s language must be ‘disciplined and grave’.<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> ‘Docente
te in ecclesia’, said Jerome elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> ‘non clamor populi sed
gemitus suscitetur.’ Gallus, in Sulpicius Severus,<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> expresses
his contempt for flowery language. ‘For if you call me a
disciple of Martin (the stern saint of Tours) you must also
allow me the right of following him in despising vain ornamental
speech and verbal embellishment’ (<i>sermonum faleras et verborum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
ornamenta</i>). In a sermon on Rebecca, attributed to Caesarius,<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>
the preacher proclaims the principle of adaptability: ‘The educated
must accommodate themselves to the ignorance of the
simple. If, in expounding holy Scripture we desired the arrangement
and the eloquence of (certain) holy fathers, ... the food
of doctrine could reach only a small band of scholars (there is
a secret satisfaction in having had a superior training), while the
remaining masses of the people would go unfed. And therefore
I humbly ask that the ears of the learned bear patiently the
words of simplicity (<i>rustica verba</i>) if only the whole flock of God
may partake of spiritual food by means of speech unadorned and
(if I may say so) pedestrian.’ Ruricius, Bishop of Limoges, and
a contemporary of Sidonius,<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> speaks of his ‘ineptia rusticitatis’,<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>
his ‘rusticus sermo’.<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> ‘Rusticitatem meam’, he says, ‘malo
prodere quam perdere caritatem’.<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a></p>

<p>This prevalent cultivation of ‘rusticitas’ was, as has been
said, partly a reaction, and like all reactions it had a tendency to
go too far. It is not surprising to find men like Jerome protesting
(though with self-condemnation) against the bald style of
certain Christian writings.<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> Heyne, after describing the ‘verborum
fucos, concinnos et calamistrum’ of the rhetoricians, remarks
on the uncultured and disgusting lack of style into which the
later writers fell. It was natural, he says, that, having thrown
eloquence overboard, they should fall into ‘barbaries’ and
subjects vulgar and essentially trivial (<i>per se tenuia</i>). The charge
of ‘barbaries’ is admitted. But the subject-matter was not
always ‘per se tenuia’; it was essentially the reverse: and the
‘horrida oratio’ into which the Christian writers fell had the
compensation of sincerity and the capacity of rising into genuine
eloquence.</p>

<p>We have, then, these two facts: the persistence in Christian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
thought of rhetoric, and the reaction in the direction of simplicity.
But we must ask what the Christian attitude was towards
pagan education as a whole, for on this attitude largely depended
the nature of the Christian schools.</p>

<p>Sulpicius Severus is uncompromisingly harsh. All literature
except the Bible and theological writings are utterly vain. ‘For
what did the pagan writers themselves gain by a literary glory
that was to perish with their generation? Or what profit was
it to posterity to read of Hector’s battles or Socrates’ philosophy?
Not only is it folly to imitate those writers, but not to attack
them with the utmost fierceness is sheer madness....’<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> The
pagan philosophy has been a mighty bane. ‘Qui quidem error
humanus (pagan philosophy) litteris traditus in tantum valuit ut
multos plane aemulos vel inanis philosophiae vel stultae illius
virtutis invenerit.’<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> Tertullian, Arnobius, and Lactantius on
entering the Church abjured the heathen literature,<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> and Jerome
conceived of the difference between the two groups of writers as
that between light and darkness.<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> Philosophy was regarded
as dangerous, and extensive secular reading deprecated.<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> Poetry
was banned because it inflamed passion,<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> and Claudius Victor of
Marseilles went so far as to trace the misfortunes of his day to
the pagan schools and authors.</p>

<p>‘Is not ours the blame?’ he wails: ‘Paul and Solomon are
neglected and the Vergil who wrote of Dido and the Ovid who
described Corinna are recited, the verses of Horace are applauded
and the scenes of Terence, and it is we, we who are at fault,
we who basely feed those flames.’<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> Paulinus writes to his old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
master Ausonius who is much concerned because his pupil has
deserted the Muses, and declares with pathetic firmness that the
Christian heart must needs say ‘No’ to Apollo and the Muses.
‘New is the force and greater the god that now moves the soul,
and he permits not leisure in work or play for the literature of
fable.’<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> To him the education and the literature of the pagan
world is nothing but ‘the clever influence of a sophist, the knack
of a rhetor, the false imagination of a bard’, and its professors
men who miss the truth,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In order to understand this exclusive spirit we must remember
the circumstances: the tenacity of paganism, which had taken
its last stand in the public amusements,<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> the persecutions, the
close connexion between the schools and the old religion. The
Gallic panegyrists (most of them teachers) ostentatiously proclaim
the gods of ancient Rome even to Christian emperors like
Theodosius.<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> ‘Di boni’ and ‘Di immortales’ appear everywhere,
the emperor is divine, and the school at Autun is ‘aedes Herculis
atque Musarum’.<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> The rhetorical education had the immense
advantage of being traditional. Then, as now, the argument
carried great weight. Libanius in his defence of dancing asks
indignantly (and the method of his protest is typical) whether
the settled opinion of the ancients in this matter is to be upset:
ἆρ’ οὖν πρᾶγμα ἀρχαῖον, καὶ παρὰ τοῖς οὕτω γενναίοις οὕτω
γενναῖον καὶ καλὸν εἶναι δοκοῦν, εἰκῆ καὶ ῥᾳδίως ἡμεῖς τῶν
φαύλων εἶναι πιστεύσομεν;<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> Everything that was not cut
according to the traditional pattern, according to the opinions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
handed down with hardly any criticism, from one teacher to
another,<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> tended to be despised, and this was the attitude towards
the Christians in the educational world of the day.<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> Moreover,
the old system was properly organized, and Christians in being
compelled to send their children to pagan masters felt the
danger. For the subject-matter of both the grammatical and
the rhetorical schools was largely the pagan mythology, which
was next door to religion. Even contemporary literature proclaimed
pagan ideas: the fourth-century comedy <i>Querolus</i> is
permeated by the heathen conception of fate.</p>

<p>To all these causes of opposition and bitterness towards the
pagan culture, there were added the desperate earnest of these
early Christians to whom salvation and perdition were piercing
and vivid realities, and the bitter scorn of pagans like Rutilius
Namatianus. As he returned to his native country, Gaul, he saw
in the growth of monachism one of the causes of Rome’s decline—Rome
who had all his devotion, whose magistrate he was proud
to have been.</p>

<p class="noindent">he says of Capraria,<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> where a monastery had been started. Pride
and prejudice make the monks an inexplicable problem to him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Munera fortunae metuunt, dum damna verentur.<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Either they are really criminals forced to live this sort of life, or
else the slaves of black bile. To him, too, the youth who becomes
a monk is ‘impulsus furiis’.<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> Such was the temper towards the
Christians even as late as the fifth century, and the counterpart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
of this bitterness is seen in the murder of Hypatia in Alexandria
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 415).</p>

<p>The attitude of the ‘extreme’ Christians towards pagan literature
is not, therefore, entirely inexplicable. But all were not
extreme. The better spirits like Augustine, realizing that
Christian education inevitably depended largely on the nobles
who had come to the Church from the rhetorical schools, went
on the principle of ‘spoiling the Egyptians’, of taking from
pagan education and literature whatever was good and useful.
Jerome protests against the narrow standpoint with considerable
emphasis. He criticizes those who neglect style, and flares up at
the suggestion that he is afraid of the pagan training of his
opponents in controversy.<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> Ignorance, he says, is not holiness,
and lack of culture is unfitting in a student of the Apostles. ‘Nec
rusticus et tantum simplex frater ideo se sanctum putet si nil
noverit, nec peritus et eloquens in lingua aestimet sanctitatem.’<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>
He felt the need of rhetoric as a weapon against opponents. A
holy ignorance, he argued, is a gain only to itself (he is curiously
reluctant either to accept pagan learning entirely or to condemn
it utterly), but all it builds up of the Church of Christ is lost if
it does not meet its opponents.<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p>So, too, Paulinus of Nola and Prudentius ‘quidquid e paganis
operibus novae fidei non adversabatur laudabant et servabant’.<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>
Sedulius, again, refused to draw the rigid line which the extremists
drew: he wants to retain the culture of his time, but in
a Christianized form. In the dedication of his <i>Carmen Paschale</i>
to Macedonius he argues that he writes in verse because ‘there
are many who, owing to their training in secular studies, are
attracted rather by the delights of verse and the pleasures of
poetry’; and that the Church must make use of this artistic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
tendency in people (<i>horum mores non repudiandos aestimo</i>). They
will remember divine truths better if they are pleased with the
form in which they are presented, and everybody must be freely
won for God along the line of his particular bent (<i>ut quisque suo
magis ingenio voluntarius acquiratur Deo</i>). The way in which you
approach the faith does not matter so long as you get there and
remain there.<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> It is clear that he stands for liberalism in this
matter and does not object to pagan literature if only the object
in view is the right one.</p>

<p>Thus the wiser among the Christians opposed the policy of
exclusiveness. They foresaw that though bigoted zeal and a
natural antipathy might keep out pagan letters for a time, in
the end they could not do so; and they realized that it was one
of the functions of the Church to hand down what was good
in the old culture. So the two Apollinarii (fourth century),
Christian teachers of Laodicea, turned the Old Testament into
heroic verse and the New Testament into Platonic dialogues;<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>
Juvencus put the gospels into metre, and Nonnus wrote out
St. John in hexameters. In order to appeal to the intellectual
classes the Christian writers were bound to follow the pagan
models, and so a virtue was made of necessity: for amid the
distraction of the failing Empire it was the Church alone that
could have saved the form and content of the ancient culture
by providing scribes for the one and thinkers for the other.
It would have been interesting to have Paulinus of Nola’s
Panegyric on Theodosius. ‘Quid interfuerit tum inter Christianum
oratorem, et oratorem, in scriptis saltem, paganum’ (says
Monnard<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a>) ‘diiudicare liceret, nisi temporis invidia Panegyrico
Theodosii, quem Paulinus scripserat, quemque cum Ausonii
Panegyrico conferre potuissemus nos privavisset.’ We should
also have been able to see how far he followed the pagan model,
especially in view of his extreme statements to Ausonius<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> on the
subject of pagan literature. Probably he was just as rhetorical
as Hilary in his Demosthenic denunciation of Constantine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
This supposition is confirmed by the words of Jerome, who is
enthusiastic in his praise of the speech. ‘If the author’, he says,
‘surpasses others in the beginning of his oration, towards the end he
excels himself. His style is brilliant with Ciceronian purity, yet
copious in thought.’<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> There was a certain amount of hypocrisy
in the railing of the Christian writers against the pagan authors.</p>

<p>In spite of her criticism and antipathy, therefore, the Church
listened to her leaders in their wiser moods and saved pagan
culture. She set her monks to copy the ancient authors.<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a>
Augustine ‘brought Plato into the (Christian) schools under his
bishop’s robe’, and even Jerome expounded lyric and comic poets
to the children at Bethlehem.<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> Vergil, in particular, was
admitted on account of the prophecy supposed to be contained in
the fourth <i>Eclogue</i>. Roman law, of which Bossuet said that good
sense, the master of human life, reigned throughout it, was
regarded by the Church as a reflection of divine justice, and
studied more particularly on account of its supposed similarity
to the law of Moses.<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> Through the Church it passed to the
barbarians, and so became a heritage of the civilized world.</p>

<p>This ultimate attitude of the Church is the determining factor
of Christian education, and it forms the background without
which that education cannot be rightly studied. Kaufmann
maintains that towards the end of the fifth century the rhetorical
school lost its pedagogic significance,<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> but his statement needs
modification. The number of the rhetorical schools in Gaul
certainly decreased as Christianity advanced during the fifth
century: their spirit, their importance and meaning for education
survived and, to a large extent, still survives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Rise of Christian Schools in Gaul</span></h3>

<p>One of the ways in which Christianity supplemented paganism
was the development of elementary schools. It began with the
masses, where knowledge was small and opportunities few, but
these common people it inspired with a desire to learn and made
them potential scholars, who, though backward, were yet not
decadent, and who shared their spiritual possessions with one
another just as much as their material property.</p>

<p>In touching this kind of man Christian education did what
the pagan schools had neglected to do, as we have seen, on
account of the rigid class-distinctions. In paying particular
attention to elementary education the Church followed her own
needs and Christ’s example of sympathy with children. In so
far as the Church applied the Pauline teaching of the essential
brotherhood and equality of man these hard distinctions tended
to disappear, and education became more generally diffused.
There was a real democratization of letters, but the masses had
so long been neglected that the diffusion was very slow. Caesarius
knew prominent business men who could not even read or write.<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>
Their culture consisted largely in folk songs and tales handed
down by word of mouth. And besides, the Church was not
always true to her principles: the pagan influence, backed as it
was by education, proved too strong when it came to organization.
The old relation of simple sincerity between clergy and
congregation had long passed away, and the fifth century was
a time of ecclesiastical dissensions. The bishops were chosen
more and more from the aristocracy, and the sort of church
‘cursus honorum’ which had been instituted soon created
barriers. In theory the government of the Church was democratic,
but Sidonius gives us a picture of the practice at the
episcopal elections, which shows how unstable the democracy
was. On one occasion there was a great tumult caused by the
contending candidates: one boasts of his ancient see, one relies
on the attractiveness of his kitchen, a third has a secret arrangement
whereby he will allow his followers to pillage the church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
property if he is elected. Finally, the bishops, Euphranius and
Patiens, take the matter into their own hands, nominate an
obscure worthy man, a ‘reader’ called John, and proclaim him
their colleague.<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> So, too, at Bourges, Sidonius is asked by the
faction-wearied people to nominate them a bishop.<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> In fact, the
general impression, derived from reading the account of bishops
and their elections in Sidonius, is that they would have said with
Horace, in exactly the same pagan spirit (though they might
have resented being connected with a pagan name), ‘Odi profanum
vulgus et arceo’. They go in for charities,<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> but these are
often only a form of patronage.</p>

<p>Thus, in attempting to provide for plebeian education, Christianity
had to contend with many difficulties. The first appearance
of organized Christian education is represented by the
catechumen schools which sprang up everywhere after the
establishment of Christianity. The most prominent one was
that of Alexandria,<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> dating at least from the second century.
The bishop, or, more frequently, a subordinate church official,
following the Apostolic example,<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> would go to some lecture-hall
after the sermon and expound the doctrine of the Church to all
who cared to come, or would gather his disciples round him in
some private house. The school was therefore intended for
adults. It had no formal organization nor was it of a permanent
character. It was a kind of missionary movement that spread
to all parts of the Empire. Among the first attempts in the
direction of Christian elementary education, apparently, was
the school at Edessa, where Lucian, a presbyter of the third
century, who became famous as a teacher at Antioch,<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> was educated.<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>
It was a place worthy of being a cradle of Christian
education; its church was martyred in the second century, its
teachers Protogenes and Eulogius were driven into banishment
in the fourth, and in the fifth it became famous for its active
share in the Nestorian controversy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>But in the West it was that ‘invasion from the South’,
which Montalembert referred to, that was the instrument of
Christian education. Tradition said that Athanasius introduced
the idea of monasticism into Gaul (where it spread more rapidly
than anywhere else in the West<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>) during his exile at Trèves
(336-7). This influence issued in action with Martin of Tours
(the most popular saint of the Gallic Church), when he founded
the monastery of Ligugé near Poitiers, and a second and larger
one, Marmoutier (‘maius monasterium’) near Tours, about the
middle of the fourth century. When he died, at the end of that
century, there were numerous monasteries not only in the
province of Tours but in Rouen and what afterwards became
Normandy and Picardy.</p>

<p>The work of Martin influenced two men of Gaul, both of the
upper classes, and both educated in all the learning of the day—Sulpicius
Severus, ‘vir genere et litteris nobilis’,<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> and Paulinus
of Nola, the pupil of Ausonius. These men made monasticism
fashionable—so much so that even Sidonius patronized it.<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> At
the beginning of the fifth century Cassian founded the monastery
of St. Victor near Marseilles, and Honoratus the famous cloister
of Lérins. About 450 Romanus established a monastery at
Condat on the Jura, and around these centres there grew up
a network of abbeys.</p>

<p>Now at this time there were no orders of monks, and the Rule
of the Abbeys depended mainly on the choice of the abbot. The
monasteries were merely groups of people who had come to live
the common life (κοινόβιοι) and to discuss matters of common
interest. Thus educational development was stimulated, and we
find a much stronger intellectual life among the simple Christians
than in the form-bound school of the rhetor. Whenever there
was a dangerous heresy abroad in Gaul, Jerome or Augustine
would write a refutation which was circulated throughout the
country,<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> and Sulpicius’s <i>Life of Martin</i> was eagerly read everywhere,
and was much in demand at Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>This intellectual activity presently overflowed the boundaries
of the monastery. Catechumens had to be trained for the
Church, and it was found necessary to establish informal schools
for them, where, besides religious training, they also received
a smattering of the seven liberal arts. These were the forerunners
of those cathedral schools which became, in the Middle
Ages, the main intellectual support of the country.</p>

<p>The most famous episcopal school was at Arles, where Hilary
taught a large number of students.<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> Among his pupils were
Cyprian, Bishop of Toulouse, Firminius, Bishop of Usez (Ucetia),
and Bishop Vivencius. The interest of the Fathers in education
may be illustrated from the life of Caesarius.<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> ‘Who can
describe how great and pleasing was the zeal that shone forth
from him, when he discussed the Scriptures and expounded
difficulties? His greatest delight was to be challenged to
discuss a problem, and he himself very often urged his class,
saying to us: “I know you don’t understand everything: why
don’t you ask, that you may know?”’ Whatever may be said
as to the extent of their teaching, it must be admitted that they
showed the proper spirit of education in thus stimulating
knowledge. At Arles, also, taught Pomerius, ‘scientia rhetor,
Afer genere’,<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> whose interest in literature and rhetoric was
great,<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> and whose lectures Caesarius attended. Another famous
Christian teacher of the fifth century, versed particularly in
ecclesiastical matters, was Victorius of Marseilles.<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p>The monastery of St. Victor at Marseilles,<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> built in the woods
over the grotto where the martyr Victor, a Roman legionary,
had been buried at the end of the third century, became a school
for training the clergy, though not at once, for the motto of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
founder was to flee all bishops and women.<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> It did good work,
but its fame is almost entirely eclipsed by that of the older
monastery at Lérins, the nursery of bishops. Vincent the
theologian,<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> Patrick of Ireland, Cassian the founder of St. Victor,
Hilary of Arles, Faustus the bishop of the <i>via media</i> in theological
controversy,<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> Lupus, called by Sidonius ‘episcopus episcoporum’,<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a>
Eucherius, and many other celebrities were sons of Lérins.
From Lérins and St. Victor were drawn almost all the educated
clergy of Gaul during the fifth century. ‘En général’, says
Fauriel,<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> ‘ce furent ces évêques ou ces prêtres, sortis des cloîtres
de Lérins ou de Saint-Victor, qui formèrent la partie érudite et
savante du clergé ou de l’épiscopat gallo-romain....’ The
<i>Chronologia Lerinensis</i><a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> likens Lérins to a trailing vine which fills
the earth with its fruits and extends, by the grace of God,
beyond the rest. Among the many other references to the
monastery in the Chronicle, there are numerous verse panegyrics
extolling its congenial surroundings and indicating a real love of
learning. Sidonius, too, is enthusiastic in its praise;<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> and his
commendation, imbued as he was with rhetorical culture and
prejudiced in its favour, says much for the educational standard
reached by Lérins. So famous was its school that Lupus, ‘the
prince of prelates’, came to study there for a year, before he
went to spread its spirit of study and piety. For, like most of
these monks from the aristocracy, ‘he had ... a cultivated
mind and took an active interest in intellectual development.
He was anxious about schools and educational facilities in his
diocese, and gave protection to all who encouraged learning.’<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>
Indeed, we may say that all the most literary and philosophic
men of the time, as well as the most religious, flocked to the
island-quiet of Lérins. It is no wonder that Mamertus, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
describing the failing culture of the fifth century, mentions
Lérins as an exception.</p>

<h3>4. <span class="smcap">The Practice of Christian Education</span></h3>

<p>In the <i>Chronologia sacrae insulae Lerinensis</i><a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> we find a concrete
example of a monastic school.</p>

<p>‘At the time when the studies of the monastery of Lérins
flourished in the regions of Gaul, the Christian religion ...
began to grow everywhere and <i>to commit itself to the study of
letters</i>. In this place there was an excellent abbot, a holy man,
Caesarius, the servant of Christ, who afterwards became bishop
of Arles.’ Amid the general flocking of people to Lérins for
education or edification (‘cumque ad eum omnes unanimiter concurrerent
<i>pro salute animarum sive studiis litterarum</i>’), there came
an Italian soldier and his son Siffredus, earnestly craving admittance.
The soldier became a monk, and his son was put to
school (‘filius vero <i>litterarum studiis traditur</i>’), and in a short time
he attained proficiency in ‘grammar’, rhetoric, and dialectic.</p>

<p>Similarly, Salvian sends a fellow countryman of his to be
educated at Lérins,<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> and we may judge from the Regula of
Caesarius that many boys went there for instruction. Laymen
were not excluded. In 480 St. Melanius attended a school at
Rennes controlled by priests, yet apparently attached to no
monastery.<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> That such semi-theological schools existed in Gaul,
at least from the beginning of the fifth century, we may judge
from the fact that the sons of Eucherius, Veranius and Salonius,
were taught at Lérins in subjects religious and profane<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> during
the first years of that century.<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> Not unjustifiable, therefore, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
the statement of Barralis that Lérins was ‘litterarum et virtutis
emporium’.<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a></p>

<p>But while the existence of Christian schools cannot be questioned,
their extent and organization in Gaul during the fifth
century are vague and undefined. St. Benedict’s example had
not yet brought about an ordered system of monasteries, and
there was still much that was erratic and irregular. Though the
leaders of the Church in the main allowed the use of pagan
studies in Christian teaching, yet in practice the methods
employed must have depended on the sympathy and the inclination
of the autonomous abbot. Now where an abbot had enjoyed
a rhetorical training, we can hardly doubt that he imparted it
to his pupils: for it requires a great deal of intellectual development
in a master not to teach as he has been taught. But only
a certain proportion of abbots could have had this training.
There were many brilliant monks, many perhaps of whose distinction
we do not know. But they could not have directed all
the monasteries of fifth-century Gaul. The temper of the
people, too, was all against literary studies. The number, therefore,
of such schools as Lérins, in which secular and religious
studies were simultaneously kept up, was probably not large.
In the following century the division between secular and
religious schools became progressively marked, chiefly owing to
the influence of Cassiodorus. The division between one Christian
school and another was naturally far from rigid; we read of
Honoratus sending three of his scholars at Lérins to hear the
lectures of Paulinus at Nola.<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>

<p>The children who came to the monastery schools were of two
kinds: the <i>oblati</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> who remained and became monks, and those
who attended the <i>schola exterior</i> and lived a secular life after
their education. The age at which they were admitted was an
early one. Ennodius says that Epiphanius became a ‘lector’ at
eight,<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> and Sidonius that Bishop John of Châlons-sur-Marne was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
‘lector ab infantia.’<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> Nunneries, like the one at Arles, took
children at six or seven—‘ab annis sex aut septem, quae iam
litteras discere et obedientiae possit obtemperare’.<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<p>Classes were generally held in the body of the church (<i>in inferiori
Basilicae navi</i><a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>) and the twenty-fourth canon of the fourth
Council of Toledo (seventh century) probably represents the
regular practice of our period. It provides that the children of
the clergy should all be kept in one room to be trained in the
ways of the Church, and that they should be entrusted to
a senior person of approved character who was to give them both
moral and intellectual instruction.<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></p>

<p>We hear of a head master variously called in later times
‘Scholasticus’, ‘scholaster’, ‘capischola’ (<i>caput scholae</i>) ‘Decanus’,
‘Cancellarius’. ‘Cum igitur Levitas feceris’, wrote Remigius,
‘Archidiaconum institueris Primicerium scholae clarissimae.’<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a>
A sixth-century inscription of Lyons<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> reads: ‘In hoc tomolo
requiescit famolus D̅I̅ Stefanus primicirius scolae lectorum....’</p>

<p>Private teaching, which had always gone side by side with
the schools, increased in the fifth century among Christian
parents for three reasons: the opposition of pagan to Christian
education, which, amid the unorganized state of the monastery
schools, often forced home-education upon parents; the fact that
the pagan schools catered chiefly for the upper classes and
that Christianity was now inspiring the masses with a desire for
instruction; and the influence of the monastic ideal which
shunned public contact for fear of contamination.</p>

<p>In so far as the Christian writers refer to the detailed practice
of Christian teaching, they deal chiefly with the elementary
school, which is what we should expect. Protogenes, when
banished from Edessa in the latter part of the fourth century,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
set up a school at Antinoe (<i>Antinoopolis</i>), on the Nile. τόπον
εὑρὼν ἐπιτήδειον καὶ τοῦτον διδασκαλεῖον καὶ παιδευτήριον
ἀποφήνας, μειρακίων κατέστη διδάσκαλος, καὶ ... γράφειν τε
εἰς τάχος ἐδίδασκε καὶ τὰ θεῖα ἐξεπαίδευε λόγια.<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> Writing
then (including shorthand), and scripture lessons (especially the
Psalms and the Doctrine of the Apostles), formed the substance
of his teaching. And the same general scope was found in the
West. With considerable elaboration Jerome expounds to Laeta
the method by which she is to teach her daughter the alphabet.
She is to be supplied with letters carved of wood or ivory and
be encouraged to play with them, for in playing she will learn.<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>
In this, as in most other educational matters, he follows the
mighty authority of Quintilian.<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> He deprecates a fixed order
of the letters so that only the sequence is remembered. The
child must mix the letters frequently, and then put them together
for herself, ‘in order that she may learn to recognize them by
the eye as well as by the ear’. Seneca’s motto<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> about the
visual being stronger than the acoustic memory seems to have
held an important place in the education of the day.<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> Elsewhere
Jerome explains his method for learning to read. ‘Itaque
Pacatula nostra hoc epistolium post lectura suscipiat. Interim
modo litterarum elementa cognoscat, iungat syllabas, discat
nomina, verba consociet.’<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> He advocates the usual method
of proceeding from letters to syllables, from syllables to words,
from words to sentences. Again Quintilian is followed.<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a>
Modern experimental psychology inclines to the view that the
analytic method, which proceeds from sentences and words to
syllables and letters, may be the more profitable.</p>

<p>Reading was a specially important subject on account of the
‘lectores’ who read the lessons in church. Originally they were
charged with the reading of Scriptures, but later their duties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
became more general. The ‘lectores’ formed the second of the
minor orders, and the office demanded a certain amount of
education, though sometimes the ‘lectores’ seem to have been
no more than choir boys. Isidore of Seville states that any one
who is promoted to this office must be trained in books and learning,
and well equipped with a knowledge of words and their
meanings.<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> The eighth canon of the fourth Council of Carthage
describes the solemn ordination of a ‘lector’.<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> Sometimes
qualifications of birth and rank added to the dignity of the office.
Julian, the emperor, and his brother Gallus were admitted as
readers into the church of Nicomedia, and Paulinus of Nola
tells us that St. Felix was a ‘lector’.<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> The readers stood, as has
been indicated, under a ‘primicerius’, who was also the head of
all the minor orders. ‘Ad primicerium’, said Gregory, ‘pertinent
acolythi et exorcistae, psalmistae atque lectores.’<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a></p>

<p>On the teaching of writing Jerome again follows Quintilian
in recommending a tracing of the letters on the wax for the
help of the pupil.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> ‘Cum vero coeperit trementi manu stilum
in cera ducere, vel alterius superposita manu teneri regantur
articuli, vel in tabella sculpantur elementa ut per eosdem sulcos
inclusa marginibus trahantur vestigia....’<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> These wax-tablets,
dating from ancient Roman times, go on into the
eleventh century.<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> Copying was, of course, an important part
in the monastic writing activities, and Sulpicius Severus says
that it was assigned to the ‘brethren of younger years’.<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> Such
was the importance attached to it, that in the less advanced
cloisters, like that of Martin, no other art was practised.<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> Even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the nuns practised it. We find Caesarius exhorting them to
vary their reading and psalm singing with transcribing, under
the supervision of the abbess,<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> and it was so that Rusticula,
abbess of Arles, trained her nuns.<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p>

<p>One of the borrowings from the pagan schools which the
Church found most useful was shorthand. The bishops had
their ‘notarii’ just as much as the officials of the imperial Civil
Service. They were employed to take down the proceedings of
the Councils, the <i>acta</i> of the martyrs,<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> and the speeches and
sermons of the prominent clergy. Their prevalence has been the
plague of commentators, and has contributed much to the formlessness
of Christian writing. For the scribe would take down
the bishop’s speech verbatim and copy it out as it stood. There
was no revision or rearrangement, and many errors and much
diffuseness was the result, as in the Homilies of Hilary of
Poitiers.<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> Hilary of Arles, Honoratus tells us, used to have
a ‘notarius’. ‘Sedili mensaque apposita liber ingerebatur et
retia,<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> adstante notario. Liber praebebat animo cibum, manus
nectendi velocitate currebant, notarii simul ferebantur articuli
et oculus paginam percurrebat.’<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> Evidently the possession of
a ‘notarius’ did not mean a decrease in activity, mental or
otherwise. Similarly, Jerome on a certain occasion was compelled
by his friend Ausonius to send for his secretary and
dictate a letter to the bereaved Julian, and ‘as the words fell
swiftly from his lips, they were swiftly overtaken by the hand of
the writer’.<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> Again, he describes the vigour of his secretarial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
department in terms of martial ardour and excitement: ‘ecce
noster Ausonius coepit schedulas flagitare, urgere notarios, et
hinnitu ferventis equi, ingenioli mei festinus arguere tarditatem’.<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>
That shorthand was connected with the schools is clear enough
from Prudentius.<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> He tells us of a tablet in a church at Forum
Cornelii representing the martyr Cassianus who had been a
teacher of stenography.</p>

<p>Transcribers of books were patronized by wealthy families,
and apparently sent from one house to another. Sidonius<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>
recommends to Ruricus one who had copied out the Heptateuch,
and had on sale also a copy of the Prophets, which he had
edited. The man was evidently of low social standing, for
Sidonius leaves it to Ruricus to fix the price of the work; yet he
must have had a considerable education to have been able to edit
the Prophets. We hear also of a citizen of Clermont who had
wormed out of the copyist or bookseller (<i>scriba sive bibliopola</i>) of
Remigius at Rheims a copy of the latter’s Declamations,<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> which
shows that the scribe was sometimes also the librarian.</p>

<p>In arithmetic, the strict monastic rules for silence, which
made it necessary, for example, to ask for things at meals by
signs,<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> increased the Roman tendency to finger-computation. How
elaborate a system was thus worked out we may see from Bede’s
work on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> Great stress was laid on the ‘Computus’,
a set of tables for calculating astronomical events and the
movable dates of the calendar. It was regarded by Cassiodorus
as indispensable for the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> The ‘calculus’ of Victorinus
of Aquitaine, who invented a new Paschal calendar about the
middle of the fifth century, was frequently used.<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> The idea of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
mystical numbers, derived from Pythagoras, led to much fanciful
nonsense in the Middle Ages, as we may see from Alcuin’s letter
to his pupil Gallicellulus,<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> in which he compared the numbers
mentioned in the Old Testament with those of the New.</p>

<p>We have seen that monastic education, where, as at Lérins,
the abbot was sympathetic, extended beyond the range of
theological or church subjects. The Chronicle of Lérins insists
on this,<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> and its statements are borne out to a certain extent by
the inscriptions, which show how strongly Vergil’s influence

<p class="noindent">and the words ‘Subiectasque videt nubes et sidera caeli’<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> in an
inscription on a Bishop of Arles recall the verse describing the
apotheosis of Daphnis. An inscription of Narbonne, belonging,
probably, to the fifth century, has the phrase ‘summi rector
Olimpi’.<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> As for the Fathers, they are constantly bursting
forth into Vergilian language. Paulinus, in the midst of his
tirade against the pagan Muses, in the heat of his appeal to
turn to the Christian God, slips into ‘inania murmura miscent’,<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a>
and Jerome, while urging Julianus to become a monk, ends with
a Vergilian quotation: he must follow the example of the Holy
Vera, ‘et sit tibi tanti dux femina facti’.<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> Thus the Christian
writers by their own words prove the folly of the extreme
anti-pagan point of view, even when they themselves have
held it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>We may take it, then, that Vergil was read. We hear also
of the fables of Avianus, who lived under the Antonines,<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> and
the fourth-century <i>Disticha Catonis</i>, a collection of moral rules.
The former work remained in the schools till the tenth century,
while the latter was among the commonest of elementary school-books
as late as the sixteenth and seventeenth century.<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> The
text-books of the grammarians were no doubt freely used.
Sidonius praises the ‘discipline’ of Agroecius<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> (fifth century),
who wrote a famous work on Orthography, intended to supplement
a book on the same subject by Flavius Caper. It is
significant that the work is dedicated to Bishop Eucherius. As
we go into the sixth century the traces of the mediaeval trivium
and quadrivium begin to appear.<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> The fifth century was a
transition period, in which the doctrine of the extreme monastic
party (if we may speak of a party when so many eminent men
spoke now on the one side and now on the other), and the teaching
of the liberals, were represented in the schools in fluctuating
and uncertain proportions. By the time of Gregory of Tours
(sixth century) the extremists had so far given way that he
allowed his theological students to pass through the seven arts of
Capella, and to write poetry, which, however, was still suspect,
and had fallen from its previous prominence to a precarious place
at the end of the list.</p>

</div>

<p>When we take all this into account we cannot fail to see a
certain exaggeration in Kaufmann’s<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> statement that the training
of the monastic school was entirely religious and moral.
These elements were doubtless predominant, but they were not all.</p>

<p>During the fifth century, however, subjects for reading and
discussion came to be taken more and more from the Bible.
The Bible, introduced as literature in the schools, started its
career of enormous influence on the speech and writings, and so
on the education, of all centuries. The hexameters into which
Claudius Marius Victor of Marseilles (fifth century) turned the
book of Genesis were meant for use in schools, and represented
a sort of compromise: Christian matter and pagan form. Psalm
singing and lessons in scripture and church ritual were naturally
given a fairly prominent place. Exegesis became the main
subject of study, as we may see, e.g. from Eucherius’s <i>Formularum
spiritualis intelligentiae</i>, <i>Instructionum libri</i>, <i>Dialogorum liber</i>.
Scripture, he says, is to be discussed and explained ‘secundum
historiam, secundum tropologiam, secundum anagogen’.<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> ‘Historia’
is given a wide definition: all that comes under ‘veritatem
factorum ac fidem relationis’. ‘Tropologia’ is to lead to the
improvement of life and of the mystic intellect, and ‘Anagoge’
leads ‘ad sacratiora caelestium figurarum’. These two sides,
which are speculative and philosophical, are developed at the
expense of ‘Historia’; and falsely developed by abundant reference
to allegorical explanation, which becomes a regular solvent
of obscure questions.<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>Stress is also laid on the etymological side, which is rather
unfortunate. Greek and Hebrew are studied to some extent,
though the answers which Eucherius, following the example of
Jerome, wrote to the questions of his son Salonius on these
subjects suggest rather a low standard. Curious as this
catechism is, some of the theological questions indicate considerable
thought:</p>

<p>‘Scribitur in Genesi tentavit Deus Abraham, quasi ignorabat
Dominus an fidelis Abraham foret.’</p>

<p>‘Si Deus hominem immortalem fecerit, quemadmodum potuit
mori?’</p>

<p>‘Quomodo accipiendum est quod legimus Regnum Dei intra
vos est?’</p>

<p>‘Cum nulla esse ignorantia apud Deum possit, quomodo ipse
in libro Geneseos in exordiis dicit Dominus: Adam, ubi es?’<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a></p>

<p>This part of Christian education as reflected in the Books of
Instruction stands in sharp contrast to the part which deals with
language, and suggests that the theological training far overshadowed
the rest. Even at Lérins the distinctly pagan
education was given very little prominence. Ennodius, of all
people, forgetting his debt to pagan letters, and all unconscious
of his enslavement to rhetoric, pompously states the superiority
of ‘religious’ over ‘secular’ studies, thus advising Camilla about
the education of her son: ‘The Lord of salvation rejects not
those who hasten to him from secular teachings, but he refuses
to let any one leave his glory for these. If you have already
withdrawn the child from the world, you would not seek
a worldly style in him. I blush to resort to the polish of
secular embellishments in the education of one who professes to
serve the Church.’<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a></p>

<p>That there were different grades of advancement in the
Christian schools is implied in the words of Eucherius when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
reminds his son that his education was begun by Hilary but
finished off (<i>consummatum</i>) by Vincentius and Salvian.<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> But the
general standard was undoubtedly low. To the remark of
Caesarius that many business-men in his time could not write,
we may add the testimony of the inscriptions. On four monuments
of Briord we read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Abstuta passiens dulcissema apta’,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Abstutus argus dulcissimus artus’,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Abstuti passiens dulcissimi aptu’,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Abstutus passiius dulcissernus aptus’,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">all for ‘Astutus largus patiens dulcissimus aptus’. And there are
many variations of the lines inscribed by Jerome on Paula’s tomb:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Aspicis augustum praecisa in rupe sepulcrum,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hospitium Paulae est caelestia regna tenentis,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which proclaim the ignorance of the inscribers.<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> This does not
mean that these people would have been better educated under
the pagan system: there are many instances of mistakes in
pagan inscriptions too. It merely means that Christianity was
beginning to reach the simple folk, who otherwise would probably
not have had the ability or the ambition even to make a wrong
copy of a line of verse. In the pagan schools it is the upper
classes that are prominent: in the Christian schools it is the
lower.</p>

<p>Higher education, therefore, hardly appears at all in the
Christian writers. The former rhetorical school, with its declamations
and its applause, fell away, though its influence survived.
The rules of rhetoric may have been illustrated by examples
which were applied in the pulpit, but there was no separate
school for the art of speaking. Yet the germ of the modern
university—as far as intellectual search for truth is concerned—was
found in some of the monasteries, and there is at least one
subject in which they had a contribution to make to higher
education, philosophy.</p>

<p>The curious way in which the Christian and pagan schools
supplement and oppose one another is evident throughout. The
Christian elementary school developed further the pagan system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
for lower education: the monastic studies formed an antithesis
to the social atmosphere of the Bordeaux University; and, in
particular, the study of philosophy and theology supplemented
that lack of thought which we have seen in Ausonius and the
fourth century in general. For it is in the fifth century that
the most flourishing period of Gallic theology begins. All the
greatest minds of the day busied themselves with the philosophy
of religion.</p>

<p>The main thought-currents need here only be named. First
and foremost there was Pelagianism, with its questions of grace
and free will, which raised the central problem of personality.
More directly connected with Gaul (for its leaders were Cassian
and Faustus) was Semi-Pelagianism, which sought a middle way
between the predestination implied in Augustine and the free
will of Pelagius. Then there were the questions about the
nature of the soul—whether it was corporeal, as Faustus argued,
or spiritual as Mamertus Claudianus maintained. There was
also Neoplatonism, which was never strong in the West, but
appears here and there in Hilary of Poitiers.<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> How prevalent
its incidental accompaniments of Daemonology and Divination
were appears from the decree of Valens and Valentinian against
magicians.<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> Finally, there were minor theological questions and
points of worship and church discipline, for example in the
controversy between Vigilantius and Jerome.</p>

<p>Philosophy was divided by Eucherius into three parts:
‘Sapientia mundi huius philosophiam suam in tres partes
divisit: Physicam, Ethicam, Logicam’,<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> which includes metaphysics
and theology. This was the traditional division alluded
to by Seneca: ‘Philosophiae tres partes esse dixerunt et maximi
et plurimi actores: moralem, naturalem, rationalem.’<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> Of these,
the part called ‘ethica’ or ‘moralis’ was naturally most popular,
but the sort of theological discussion that came under ‘Logica’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
was most developed by the thinkers of the time. Foremost in
this department stands Claudianus, Bishop of Vienne, whose
work <i>De Statu animae</i> was a real contribution to the thought of
his age. ‘These ideas’, says Guizot, referring to this work,
‘are deficient neither in elevation nor in profundity: they would
do honour to the philosophers of any period; seldom have the
nature of the soul and its unity been investigated more clearly or
described with greater precision.’<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> This is high praise, but it is
justified in the main. Claudianus was at least no mere compiler.
He draws largely on Augustine and the Pythagorean authors
like Philolaus, Architas, and Hippo Metapontinus (known to him,
perhaps, only in extracts), whose works are now lost.<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> Plato and
the later Platonists, too, are extensively quoted. We feel that
there is a great deal of vague metaphysics in his work, ‘purement
négative, impuissante à pénétrer dans la nature intime des
phénomènes’.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> As an example of this sort of thing we may
quote the passage<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> where he is referring to the work of Philolaus
περὶ ῥυθμῶν καὶ μέτρων, and talks about the mystic number and
the spiritual law according to which the soul enters the body, using
this thesis as a satisfactory basis for argument. He is content
to quote the ‘ipse dixit’ of Philolaus alone. ‘Memet’ (he declares)
‘causa auctoritatis in medium tanti testimonium philosophi
iecisse sufficiet.’ There was an idea (not unnaturally)
that the study of philosophy was prejudicial to religion, but
Claudianus was one, says Sidonius, ‘qui ... indesinenter <i>salva
religione</i> philosopharetur’.<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> Plato was the main inspiration.
Most of the Gallic Platonists were Christians, though Sidonius
says that those who attack Faustus for his mystic philosophy
will find ‘ecclesiae Christi Platonis academiam militare’.<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>
From Sidonius and Claudianus we should judge that Aristotle—especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
the <i>Ethics</i> and the <i>Categories</i>—was fairly prevalent
in Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a></p>

<h4><i>Methods and Masters.</i></h4>

<p>Ennodius in his lines on ‘Grammatica’<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> maintains that even
in teaching philosophy a joke with the class is permissible, and
that strict discipline must not always imply terror, and Sulpicius
Severus writes to Bishop Paul<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> commending his success in
dealing with pupils without threats or force. But, on the
whole, the pagan tradition of discipline was not mellowed by
Christianity. It was rather reinforced by the ascetic spirit of
the monasteries, and intensified by the added religious motive of
mortification. The text ‘Quem enim diligit Dominus, increpat:
flagellat autem omnem filium quem recipit’, was literally and
extensively applied. Jerome talks quite naturally of education
as equivalent to ‘manum ferulae subducere’,<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> and the severe
training of Lérins is indicated by the phrase of Sidonius; ‘post
desudatas militiae Lerinensis excubias’ (the sweated vigils of
your campaign at Lérins).<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> Valerianus, in his homily ‘De bono
disciplinae’,<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> illustrates the ideas of the time on this subject,
and strengthens the impression that we get from reading the
various ‘Regulae’ for the cloisters. He expatiates on the disciplined
order of nature, and everywhere thinks of ‘disciplina’ as
equivalent to ‘castigatio’, which is always assumed to be the
corner-stone of teaching and the condition of progress on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
part of the pupil. The militarism of the Roman Empire lingers
on in seemingly uncongenial surroundings. Great stress is laid
on fear. Fear has the great virtue of always obeying. It
therefore knows how to avoid threatening dangers, or the wrath
of judgement. Because of this estimable quality it has the power
of keeping you safe. ‘All vices are prostrate before fear.’ He
appeals to the word of the Prophet: ‘servite Domino in timore
et exultate ei cum tremore’. The Old Testament harshness
suits the temper of these disciplinarians very well, and appears
far more frequently than the gentleness of Christ or the humanity
of common sense.</p>

<p>Part of this idea of mortification and discipline was worked
out in the manual labour which the monasteries made, and
consistently have made, of considerable importance in their
educational scheme. Partly, too, it was a reaction against the
extreme artificiality of the rhetorical schools, and it was also
undoubtedly an attempt to follow Christ and his Apostles in
their adoption of some craft or trade. Mabillon shows<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> how
much this practical side was insisted on, and he speaks of
a tradition which started in Gaul during our period. The correspondence
between word and deed was made a vital point—a
fact which proved a healthy corrective to the attitude apt to
be produced by the rhetoric of the pagan schools. ‘Qui si
volunt lectioni vacare ut non operentur, ipsi lectioni contumaces
existunt, quia non faciant quod ibi legunt’,<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> said Isidore of
Seville, and his ‘Rule’, like that of Caesarius, expressed the
thought of the fifth century as well as of the seventh. We find
that at Lérins Hilary of Arles worked in the fields, and that it
was the duty of Caesarius when he first entered that monastery
to provide for the bodily needs of the brethren.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> Cassian made
a strong point of manual labour. It prevents many faults,<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> and
we have the example of St. Paul<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> and the precept of Solomon.<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a>
The East, which gave the impulse to monasticism, emphasized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
this point, for example in Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> and there is the story of the
Abbot Paul who burnt every year the work of his hands lest he
should ever lack work.<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a></p>

<p>Thus in its development of elementary education, in its
‘rusticitas’, in its greater concentration on thought, and in
its emphasis on practical work, Christian education in fifth-century
Gaul was in reaction against the brilliant but superficial
schools of the previous century. That this was so, and
that the movement was strong enough to make itself felt against
the whole weight of the traditional education, was partly due
to skilful leadership. How far was this effective leadership
general in the Christian schools?</p>

<p>Eucherius in a letter to Valerianus<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> gives a list of men who
have become monks. Clemens, ‘omni scientia refertus, omniumque
liberalium artium peritissimus’; Gregorius, ‘philosophia
primus apud mundum et eloquentia praestans’; another Gregorius,
‘litteris et philosophiae deditus’; Paulinus of Nola,
‘peculiare et beatum Galliae nostrae exemplum—uberrimo eloquentiae
fonte’; Basilius, a rhetor and a learned man; and
many others. Of Eucherius himself Claudianus says: ‘ingenio
subtilissimus, scientia plenus, eloquii profluens’.<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> There was,
therefore, considerable learning in the monasteries towards the
end of the fourth century. We have seen how many of the
aristocracy brought pagan culture into the cloisters; we have
also seen that the Christians were not without their rhetors (and
rhetorical ability implied the liberal education of the day), nor
without their theologians and philosophers. Of Hilary of Arles,
whose eloquence Honoratus praises, Gennadius says: ‘Ingenio
vero immortali aliqua et parva edidit, quae eruditae animae et
fidelis linguae indicio sunt’.<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> Even where a man did not have
the initial advantage of education and birth, he often had the
ambition and the opportunity to remedy his ignorance in the
cloister. Vincentius, who had come to Lérins after having
been a soldier, studied with such zeal that he became one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
tutors of Eucherius’s sons and wrote in a style praised by
Gennadius.<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p>Now all these men became the teachers of the Christian
schools. They taught unceasingly and with great eagerness.
They had within them the joy of the pioneer, and the inspiration
of a great ideal. And if one does not agree entirely with their
theory of education, it must be admitted that intellectually they
were in most cases better equipped than the professors of
Ausonius, and that they did more to inspire a true love of education
and to preserve the triumphs of culture. When Gaul was
separated from the Empire, it was the schools, and mostly the
Christian schools (for imperial protection of education failed
with the failing Empire), that saved civilization in Gaul and
helped to perpetuate Rome’s great contribution to the world—her
Law. Dull and uninteresting as their educational labours often
were, they were often, like Browning’s Grammarian, possessed
by a real love of learning. The pedestrian quality of the work—the
jealous watching over the text of Vergil, the copying of
manuscripts, the relentless monastic routine—was perhaps the
best service that could have been rendered to humanity. What
the world wanted, in view of the dark times that were to follow,
was a tenacious watch-dog type of loyalty to letters, not the
brilliant genius who needs somebody to look after his manuscripts.
Not only books but garden art, architecture, wood- and
stone-carving, and pottery were preserved by these watch-dogs.
The dull lack of appreciation with which we sometimes think of
their work, forgetting its true perspective, is well expressed by
Kaufmann:<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL IDEAS AND INFLUENCES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>While we have looked at the actual curricula and surroundings
of the schools, it has been possible to treat Christian and pagan
education apart. But there remain certain questions which do
not directly or entirely belong to the schools, and yet are of
importance for education because of the general educational
principles underlying them (as in the case of history or the
teaching of a strange language), or because of the ideas by
which they moulded the individuality of people (as in the case
of morality and art). Here the interplay of influences is such
that, in the brief treatment which we propose, a strict division
had better not be attempted. For not only would such a division
be tedious within so limited a compass, but the merging into
one another of customs and ideas makes it almost impossible.
The questions we have indicated will therefore be regarded as
common to either side of society.</p>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Moral Education</span></h3>

<p>To get an insight into the moral state of a bygone age is
difficult for two reasons. The first is that the subject is one on
which people are most tempted to be hypocrites in their own
case, while they delight in expatiating on the wickedness of
others, and the second, that there is an extraordinary tendency
for particular cases to fill the horizon and prevent us from
taking a general view. In our period we have to reckon with
a special form of these difficulties: the preaching habit, which,
though it was essential to Christianity, was nevertheless as much
open to abuse as pagan rhetoric was, especially when it was
a means of combating paganism. ‘The world is wide’, said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Stevenson in one of his essays, ‘and so are morals.’ But there
is a standard—that of the Sermon on the Mount—which presents
an ideal, though it does not give the right to condemn. In
trying to follow this ideal the Christians saw pagan morality in
a lurid light. How far were they justified?</p>

<p>The traditional trait of impulsiveness in the Gallic character
suggested to many writers a proneness to immorality.<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> Florus
represents Livy as saying that the Insubrian Gauls, though brutal
in spirit and abnormally large, were like their own Alpine snows:
the glow of battle dissolved them into sweat, and even slight
exertion thawed them like the sun. From this account Ammianus
differs widely when he describes the Gauls of the fourth century as
excelling in vigour and endurance irrespective of age.<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> Yet he
speaks of the ‘mollities’ of the Aquitanians.<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> Perhaps in his description
of their hardiness he was thinking chiefly of the northern
Gauls, as opposed to their slacker brothers in the south. For it
is against the south and against Aquitaine in particular that
Salvian launches all the thunder of his denunciation. The
Aquitanians need the chastisement of the barbarian invasions to
kill off the worst among them and to reform the others.<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> He
rails at length against the prevailing corruption. The theatres
‘are so scandalous that no one can with modesty speak out about
them’.<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> The performances consisted of farces, ‘cotidianae
obscenitates’,<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> ‘restes dégénérés et méconnaissables du théâtre
antique’ as Fauriel calls them.<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> The Christian clergy lose no
opportunity of condemning them. In contrast to pagan immorality,
Salvian describes the chastity of the Goths. This he
exaggerates for the sake of effect, but that there was a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
element of truth in his description is proved by the
<i>Codex Visigothorum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<p>If the preacher gives a discouraging picture of the moral
state of Gaul, so does the writer of comedy. In the fourth-century
<i>Querolus</i> much of the moral corruption pictured is due
to imitation of Plautus, and we must remember that it was
a comedy. Yet we can detect a strain of satire which is a
criticism of existing conditions. Stealing, lying, adultery,
perjury are treated as exceedingly common peccadilloes which
the household god (Lar) is only too ready to pardon in
a pleasing and jolly offender. Between the Plautine conception
of the relation of slaves to their masters and that here portrayed
we can detect no advance. On both sides morality is simply
non-existent.</p>

<p>But if we must discount the evidence both of the preacher
and of the comedy-writer, we may find a more impartial guide
than either in the Law. The Theodosian Code shows that the
aspect of a crime changed with the social status of the criminal.
There was no consistent ethical standard. If the wife of
a tavern-keeper was taken in adultery, she could be publicly
accused; but if her servant girl was so taken, she might be
dismissed as too cheap to worry about (<i>pro vilitate</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> If
a guardian corrupted his ward, he was punished by deportation
and total confiscation of his goods.<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> But a woman who had
committed adultery with her slave was put to death, and the
slave burned. So terrible did this interference with class-distinction
seem that even slaves were allowed to give information.<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a>
Again, in bringing a charge of treason which he
cannot prove, an ordinary man is subject to torture, but a slave or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
a freedman is denied an audience and crucified.<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> If a slave or
freedman brought an accusation against his master (except in
the case of treason), he was to be beheaded <i>before his charge was
examined</i>. ‘Vocem enim funestam intercidi oportet potius quam
audiri.’<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> Again, in the law of extortion, judges who have been
convicted lose the marks of imperial favour, are stripped of their
office, and ranked with the worst and lowest class in the State.<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a></p>

<p>In the opinion of the law, and therefore of the mass of the
people, being ‘pessimus’ means belonging to the plebs, and the
punishment of crime comes to consist in loss of ‘caste’.<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> That
is to say, morality becomes a matter of social position, and the
corollary is that anything may be done by those whose status is
high, as long as they manage to maintain that status, while
those at the bottom, having no status to lose, hardly care what
they do. However much we may disregard particular descriptions
of moral degeneracy, the <i>Codex Theodosianus</i> supplies
a very damning commentary on the ethical standards of the
time. Nor did the Christians effect any improvement in this
legal respect of persons.</p>

<p>We have, of course, men like Paulinus of Pella who speak of
the ‘sollers castorum cura parentum’<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> which shielded him from
every evil influence, and the <i>Parentalia</i> of Ausonius indicates
happy home-conditions. Lavisse notes this,<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> and makes much
of the domestic felicity and the tender love reflected by these
writers and by the inscriptions.<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> But, apart from the fact that
Ausonius and Paulinus were at the top of society, it is dangerous
to presume too much from epitaphs. Then, as now, convention
played a great part, and the stock phrase ‘Coniugi Karissimae’
may be as formal as the constantly recurring ‘memoriae aeternae’.
It was the fashion to write epitaphs in which the superlative was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
prominent.<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> Besides, in most of these inscriptions there is no
clue as to the dates.</p>

<p>We must conclude, then, that there was much for the
Christians to educate, in society and in themselves, if they
wanted to fulfil the Christian code of morals.</p>

<p>Turning to the question how far an attempt was made in the
pagan schools to train the moral nature, we find that it is precisely
this side of pagan education that Juvenal and Tacitus
criticized. The old Roman tradition of strict moral education
at home was impaired under the Empire by the influx of foreign
elements, and the decline is familiar from the authors of the first
century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> Seneca could see in the education of his day no
moral element,<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> and his criticisms apply to the scholars of Gaul
as much as to those of Rome. How could there be (he argued),
when the masters were so utterly corrupt? ‘The grammarians’,
he said, ‘taught merely antiquarian stuff, not ethics. They asked
whether Homer was older than Hesiod, and inquired into the
ages of Patroclus and Achilles, or the wanderings of Ulysses.’
‘Quid horum ad virtutem viam struit?’ The geometricians
teach how to survey estates, but ‘what does it profit me to know
how to divide a plot of land, if I do not know how to share with
my brother? You know what a straight line is. What good is
it, if you do not know what is straight in life? O man of learning,
let us be content with the simpler title: man of virtue.’<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> The
burden of the cry is for perspective, for an ethical basis, without
which education was seen to be like an anchorless storm-tossed
ship.<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></p>

<p>This need continues to be felt through the following centuries.
We have seen what stress Julian laid on the moral
qualifications of the teacher. His ideal was Hellenic purity.
Before him, Eumenius, on whom the imperial injunction was laid:
‘ut ... ad <i>vitae melioris</i> studium adulescentium excolas mentes’,<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
proclaimed the ideal of practical morality advocated by Cicero.
Similarly, the emperor in his zeal for education stressed the
moral side as well as the intellectual (so at least his panegyrist
maintained), and realized that letters were the basis of virtue.<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>
These virtues, he says, grow up in youth, and in manhood form
the strong support of all the various duties of citizenship,
whether in peace or war. And so letters are the cradle ‘of all
diligence and all praise’.</p>

<p>To a certain extent this demand for moral education was met
in the pagan schools. When Paulinus speaks of learning
‘dogmata Socratus’ at the age of five, what he probably means
is a selection of well-known sentences chosen for their moral
teaching.<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> The didactic nature of the fables and rhetorical
exercises has been noticed, and we cannot doubt that they played
a considerable part in the moral theory of the pagan schools.
An inscription of Limoges, belonging probably to the second
century, contains the figure of a man with a scroll in his right
hand, and the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Artis Grammatices Doctor Morumqꝫ Mag .. ter Blaesianus
Biturix’.<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The inference is that the popular conception of the grammarian’s
task included moral training. We find that ‘Grammatica’
was regarded as the nurse of the virtues. A training
is obtained through it for practical life. Not only the orator
but the soldier was supposed to be thus formed. It is the school
of the grammarian that trains the soldier whom the Campus
Martius receives. ‘Grammar’ has fired him with imaginary
battles, taught him courage by accustoming him to the apparatus
of war even among the blandishments of peace, and so will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
make him obedient to the actual trumpet call.<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> All this is
claimed for the school. Such was the theory, but what sort of
training was given in practice? It was of little use that fables
with moral tags were put before the child if there was not at
the same time the living example. And Seneca’s objection to
the character of the ‘grammatici’ seems to have held to some
extent in Gaul during our period. The disgusting picture of
social vice which Ausonius gives in the latter part of the
<i>Epigrams</i> applies in part also to the teachers. Eunus, the
pedagogue, figures prominently in the list, and Ausonius himself
speaks quite naturally about things that directly contradict the
Christian morality which he professed. There was a hollowness
in the teaching of the ‘grammaticus’ which logically followed
from the attempt to maintain the precept without the example.
The objections to the low ethical standard of the gods in
Homer, which were urged in the fifth century as in the time of
Plato and Cicero, were unheeded by the teachers, says Augustine,
even when a man of their own school (<i>ex eodem pulvere</i>) proclaimed
that Homer had transferred human qualities to the
gods.<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> A barbarism or a solecism was of more account than
a moral offence: to forget the <i>h</i> in <i>homo</i> was more serious than
to forget to love a fellow man.<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a></p>

<p>‘Liberales Artes’, Seneca had said, ‘non perducunt animum
ad virtutem, sed expediunt.’<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> We must be content if the
school-training merely creates a disposition of mind favourable
to virtue. The Christian schools went further. They insisted
on correlating theory and practice, and prescribed definite lines of
action. As against the hollowness of the pagan moral teaching
(and here again we can detect a reaction), the Christian teachers
on the whole not only tried to practise what they taught, but
saw to it that their pupils carried out their commands. They
were exhorted to do so in the Canons of the Church. They put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
before men a personal ideal, and, if their methods of striving
after it were sometimes crude and exaggerated, their sincerity
can hardly be doubted. So obsessed were they with the idea of
working out their own salvation that their teaching tended to
become oppressively moral. The long disquisitions of Jerome or
Tertullian on the minute points of moral behaviour are sometimes
positively unhealthy. But we must remember that they
represented a reaction from an extreme. And in this reaction
the seeds of a higher ethical standard were being sown. Not as
the lightning lighteth the heavens, but as the growth of the
mustard-tree, the stern teaching of the monks who saw a higher
vision and fled the world for its sake penetrated and leavened
the mass of society, whether that society called itself Christian
or not. Already in the fifth century a better public opinion was
being formed. We find Sidonius, half-pagan as he was, commending
his villa at Avitacum because of the absence of immoral
pictures and scenes—‘non hic per nudam pictorum corporum
pulchritudinem turpis prostat historia, quae sicut ornat artem sic
devenustat artificem.... Absunt lubrici tortuosique pugilatu
et nexibus palaestritae (wrestlers) quoram etiam viventum
luctus, si involvantur obscenius casta confestim gymnasiarchorum
virga dissolvit.’<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> So in his letter to his son,<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> he praises him for
loving purity and adopts the tone of the moral educator.</p>

<p>It is not suggested that the pagan efforts to advocate morality
were worth less than the Christian, or that there was a steady
and abiding advance in morals from this time onwards. Only,
there are two facts to bear in mind: the moral state of Gaul
was bad, and paganism as a motive to morality had failed.
Where then was the incentive to come from? Without claiming
for the Church any special virtue, and realizing its many
grievous errors, we must answer that the moral inspiration for
the future came at this time through Christianity. And the
Church and her schools were the channels by which this inspiration
reached the people. Thus once more Christian education
supplemented the work of the pagan schools.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One of the ways in which Christianity exercised its moral
influence consisted in raising the status of women; and this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
was done, to a large extent, by making education more general
among them.</p>

<p>In answering the question whether girls attended the schools
at Bordeaux, Jullian<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> says that this was probably the case. We
may omit the ‘probably’. It would have been strange indeed if
this had not been the case, seeing that at Rome girls’ schools go
back possibly to the time of the unfortunate Virginia<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> (449 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>),
while in the Ciceronian period Hortensia belonged to the orators,
Lesbia wrote poetry, and girls are mentioned as attending school
with the boys by Martial<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> and Ovid.<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> Moreover, Ausonius says
quite plainly to his grandson, referring to the ordinary school
course:</p>

<p>Haec olim genitorque tuus <i>genetrixque</i> secuti ...<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a>
and tells us that his aunt was a student of medicine, though he
indicates that this was not the usual thing (<i>more virum</i> medicis
artibus experiens).<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> Sometimes the mother taught her daughter
literature:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Latios nec volvere libros (says Claudianus of the bride),<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a>
desinit aut Graios, ipsa genetrice magistra.</p>

</div>

<p>But such home-education was probably rare and confined to the
upper classes. We hear of no such instance in Gaul. Yet we
know that there was sufficient interest in the classics and in
knowledge generally on the part of the Gallic women to elicit
a lament from Claudius Marius Victor. For among the signs of
corruption of his day he notes their preference for pagan authors.
Moreover, they show a knowledge of abstruse questions and a
desire to know which is truly monstrous:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Quae ... Deo tantum sunt nota, recondita cunctis,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scire volunt (heu grande nefas!) et scire videntur.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it is all the fault of the men, he says (<i>sunt nostri crimina
sexus</i>). Without the example of the husband, the wife would
never have strayed into such ways of wickedness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sic exempla virum uxores accepta sequuntur.<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Eulalia, the wife of Probus, was fond of reading the involved
writings of Sidonius,<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> who does not think it too much to expect
from a wife that she will be interested in literature. For he
reminds a friend that marriage need not interfere with his
studious habits: have not Marcia, Terentia, Calpurnia, Pudentilla,
Rusticiana, and many others ‘held the light for those who read’?<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a>
We may conclude, therefore, that while a large number of girls
received a home-education, chiefly in spinning and household
crafts,<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> many of them attended the schools and became interested
in literature.<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a></p>

<p>If there was an increasing liberalism about women’s education
in pagan circles (to take the references from Ausonius and
Sidonius under this head), the principle of a woman’s right to
education assumed much wider and more active proportions
among the Christians.</p>

<p>The spread of monasticism naturally affected a large number
of women. Marcella was the first of the noble ladies at Rome
to take the veil, and set an example which was so extensively
followed that by 412 Jerome could boast ‘crebra virginum
monasteria’.<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> Avitus in 517 called together a Church Council
at Epao (a small village south of Vienne), which regulated in
one of its canons the admission to the ‘monasteria puellarum’,<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a>
and he refers elsewhere to the cloister founded by Leonianus
where Remilia was brought up (<i>sub regulari disciplina nutrita</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a>
The nuns learnt weaving and spinning,<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> but the various
‘Regulae’, though somewhat later than our period, make it
probable that a portion of their time, at least, was spent in
reading and writing.</p>

<p>From these scattered data the point that emerges is that there
was a change of attitude towards the education and intellectual
capacity of the ordinary woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>Jerome showed quite clearly that he had no contempt for the
feminine mind as such. He considers Paula and Eustochium
competent judges of his Latin translation of the Bible, and
treats their suggestions as coming from intellectual equals.<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>
The number of books dedicated to them is remarkable, though
not when we remember that they inspired the translation.<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a>
They, and many other women like Blaesilla, Felicitas, and
Fabiola were adepts in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, and frequently
consulted Jerome on points of interpretation, as did
women from all parts of the Empire, including Gaul. For if the
rhetorical tradition was one and universal in the West, Christian
teaching in the fifth century was almost more so. ‘If Augustine
from his retreat at Hippo dictated a new treatise against the
heresies of his time, all the churches of Italy, of the Gauls and
of Spain listened with attention. Thus, at first sight, we can
only discover one sole Latin Literature which, so to speak, began
the education of all the races of the West.’<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a></p>

<p>Sedulius, who had taken the side of liberalism in the matter
of pagan literature, when discussing the dedication of his <i>Carmen
Paschale</i> makes Macedonius mention many learned presbyters.
‘Nor need you be ashamed’, he continues, ‘to follow the example
of Jerome the interpreter of the divine law, the student of the
library of heaven (<i>caelestis bibliothecae cultoris</i>), in submitting to
women, high born and of known high character, women in whose
minds the passion for sacred reading has built the sober home of
wisdom, the documents of your inmost reasoning. Who would
not wish, would not be ambitious, to please the superb judgement
of a Syncletice...?’ And he goes on to describe Perpetua,
whose wisdom (<i>gemina resplendens lampade</i>) lends lustre to that of
her sister.<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>Ennodius also testifies to the intellectual activity of women at
the close of the fifth century. In counselling his correspondents
to leave grammar and rhetoric, he recommends certain teachers.
Among these he mentions with enthusiasm ‘domna Barbara,
Romani flos genii’. She seasons her speech with a simplicity
that is at once natural and artistic, and her eloquence is enhanced
by her clarity of thought. There is also Stephania ‘splendidissimum
catholicae lumen ecclesiae’.<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> One of the points that
emerge in the <i>De Ordine</i> of Augustine is that ‘Monica is not
to be kept from discussing philosophy because of her sex’.<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, we must say that though there had been an
Aspasia in the time of Pericles, and though Hypatia taught at
Alexandria at the beginning of the fifth century, there had never
been such a general interest in education on the part of women
as in the Christian circles of the Western Empire at this time.
The references to educated women in pagan authors is slight
when compared with those in the Church Fathers. Of all
Symmachus’s letters not one is addressed to a woman, and
neither Ausonius nor Sidonius (except for one letter to his wife)
had a female correspondent; whereas not only Jerome, but
Augustine, Cyprian, Tertullian, Ambrose, all followed Christ’s
example when he taught the woman of Samaria. Yet when all is
said, we feel that the extent of female education is still small,
and that Ovid’s words still apply:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sunt tamen et doctae, <i>rarissima turba</i>, puellae.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But we also feel that there is an interest which contains
a promise for the future:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Altera non doctae turba, <i>sed esse volunt</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">History</span></h3>

<p>If a consideration of the state of moral education is necessary
to show how far teaching had an ethical basis, we may find in
an inquiry into the position and purpose of history in the
schools an indication of the political basis of education. We
have seen that in the pagan schools education as a whole was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
directed by, and aimed at the fulfilment of, the imperial policy.
In considering the sort of value attached to historical study, we
may see in greater detail how far the scientific attitude of mind
was entertained, and how far it was abused for the sake of
politics. For there is no subject which illustrates more clearly
these two possibilities.</p>

<p>The general outlook of history in our period was not very
encouraging. There were no historians except Ammianus. It
was a time when a writer like Suetonius was taken as a model.
There were, however, numerous compilations. Eutropius, for
example, wrote an abbreviated history of Rome towards the
close of the fourth century. Chronography was a science started
by Sextus Julius Africanus early in the third century, and his
example was widely followed. Eusebius, and his translator and
expander Jerome, carried on the tradition. Prosper of Aquitaine
took up the record where Eusebius had left off, and Prosper’s work
was continued by Idatius. Sulpicius Severus illustrated the same
tendency, while Rufinus, the adversary of Jerome, did important
work in translating and continuing the ecclesiastical history of
Eusebius. Dry and formless as these chronographies were, they
had the merit of giving a truer perspective of history by introducing
the cold lucidity of dates.</p>

<p>Corresponding to this activity there had appeared on the
Christian side the records of the <i>Acta Martyrum</i>. Many of
these Acta were of a legendary character, and though they were
useful for their local colour, they are certainly less valuable from
a scientific point of view than the bare chronicles.</p>

<p>This was the general position of history. Its position in the
Gallic schools was not more satisfactory. Throughout the ancient
educational tradition, from the ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία, of Posidonius
to the ‘seven liberal arts’, there had been no place for the study
of history. From Dionysius Thrax to Quintilian it is consistently
treated as a side issue.<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> Blümner says that when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
Quintilian assigned ‘historias exponere’ as one of the tasks of
the grammarian, it only meant that the teacher commented on
such historical facts as turned up in the course of his reading,
since history was not a school-subject.<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> Yet this is not always
true.<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> For from what Ausonius says in the <i>Protrepticon</i>, it
appears that at Bordeaux, at any rate, history determined the
course of the reading and not vice versa, and that it was a school-subject
to this extent that definite books were included in the
course for its sake. For Ausonius prescribes for his grandson
certain periods of Roman history: the conspiracy of Catiline,
the twelve years after the events connected with Lepidus and
Catulus, the Sertorian war.<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> Among the encyclopaedic attainments
of Staphylius, the Bordeaux teacher, is a knowledge of
Livy and Herodotus.<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> In the library of Ausonius there are</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We must, however, be careful how we interpret ‘historia’. It
was an elastic term. In the <i>Technopaegnion</i>, for example,
Ausonius has a piece ‘de historiis’,<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> but the subject-matter is
almost entirely in the shadowy realm of mythology—the ‘history’
of Narcissus, Juno, and Philomela; and when the grammarians
Crispus and Urbicus are said to be ‘callentes mython plasmata
et historiam’, we feel that the juxtaposition of the two subjects
is significant. ‘History’, Quintilian had said, ‘is akin to the
poets, a sort of prose poetry.’<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> The interest in the actual facts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
of history and their meaning is small. A teacher like Ausonius
takes very little notice of contemporary events. He refers
vaguely to ‘tempora tyrannica’,<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> and to the residence of Constantine’s
brothers at Toulouse.<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> But of all those contemporary
events which we should have expected a man in Ausonius’s
position to mention, the declaration as emperor in Gaul of the
German Magnentius (350), the campaigns of Julian against the
invading Franks (357-8), the crossing of Maximus to Gaul after
having been declared emperor in Britain (383), and the affair of
Arbogast and Eugenius (392)—these and many other contemporary
events of importance do not appear in the pages of
Ausonius.</p>

<p>If mythology was a danger for history on the one side, there
was antiquity on the other. In the former the tendency was
to wander away from facts altogether, in the latter there was
a temptation to concentrate on bare facts too much. The
historical facts which Sidonius sometimes enumerates sound very
much like an inventory.<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> Staphylius, who is noted for his
knowledge of history, was steeped in the six hundred volumes
of Varro,<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> and the antiquarian Victorius dug deep into the
musty documents of antiquity, spending on unexplored fields
a keen intellect and a tenacious memory.<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> Ausonius remarks
that this meticulous encyclopaedism had made Staphylius neglect
Cicero and Vergil,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">et quidquid Latia conditur historia.<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Victorius had the scientific spirit, but no use can be made of it
for history, which, to Ausonius, means something much nearer
to the brilliance of the rhetor than to the patient study of a
Victorius or a Staphylius, whom he regards with an airy smile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
of contempt. The ‘prompta studia’ of the ordinary teacher
who glibly talked the traditional stuff are separated with an air
of respectability from the work of such cranks as indulge in
dusty research.<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> Rocafort rightly suspects that these students
‘irrisioni, sicut Ausonio, ita cunctis Burdigalensibus fuisse’.<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>
A practical sign of this is the low position which Victorius
held: he was not even a grammarian but merely an assistant
(<i>subdoctor sive proscholus</i>),<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> poorly paid, ‘exili nostrae fucatus
honore cathedrae’. The subsidiary position of history is indicated
by Augustine when he says that it was an accessory to
‘Grammar’, and its mythological and artificial character is
criticized in the remark that it was more worked at by grammarians
than actual historians.<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a></p>

<p>It is quite clear that history was studied in a very haphazard
way. Even a teacher of sufficient prominence to deliver several<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a>
panegyrics before the emperor, such as the Gallic author of the
speech to Constantius, talks in a very vague way about some
of the best-known statements of Herodotus. ‘Xerxes, <i>ut audio</i>,
<i>Persarum rex potissimus</i>, pedicas iecit aureas in profundum....’
Unfamiliarity with Greek history is implied both on the part of
the speaker and on the part of the audience. When Ausonius
tells us that he wrote a Roman History for his son (<i>ignota
aeternae ne sint tibi tempora Romae</i><a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a>), we get the impression that
he did it largely because his name appeared in the list of consuls,
and to urge his son to follow his footsteps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">It is a pity that the main part of the work is lost, but probably
its author merely followed the tendency of the age to epitomize,
as he did in the summary of Suetonius’s lives of the Caesars.
The study of history, in fact, was merely ancillary: ‘ut aliquid
nitoris et copiae orationi afferrent (<i>sc.</i> <i>historiae studia</i>) et
aliquid materiae carmini.’<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a></p>

<p>The models followed by the historians are chosen chiefly for
their literary brilliance. Sallust is the most famous, and he
plays a large part in Ausonius’s syllabus. Orosius was greatly
influenced by Tacitus, and Arnobius by Lucretius.</p>

<p>The truth is that the ancients always regarded history more as
an art than as a science. The books of Herodotus came to be
called by the names of the Muses, Sallust and Tacitus strove
predominantly after stylistic effectiveness, and even Thucydides
gave oratorical technique a much more important place than
would now be accorded to it. Rhetoric had cast her spell over
the historians as over all the other intellectuals. Polybius alone
resisted, and suffered, in consequence, at the hands of the critics.
‘The only ancient historian’, Norden writes of him,<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> ‘who
opposed with all his might the influence of rhetoric on the
writing of history, and who, therefore, is most closely related to
the modern point of view, belongs, according to the judgement
of Dionysius of Halicarnassus ... to those dull authors whom
nobody can bear to read through.’ So far had rhetoric asserted
its sway over history, that Cicero, to whom we look for the
sane and balanced conception of rhetorical education, could say
that it was permissible for a rhetor to falsify history for the
sake of style,<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> and could describe the function of the historian as
essentially rhetorical (<i>unum ... oratorium maxime</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> A custom
that gave special scope to this view of history was the insertion of
imaginary speeches such as we find in Herodotus, Thucydides,
Sallust, and Tacitus. And not only speeches, but letters and documents
were set down in a fictitious form. Against this practice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
Quintilian, like Polybius, had warned. The orator’s task, he
maintained, was different from that of the historian. ‘Id quoque
vitandum, in quo magna pars errat, ne in oratione poetas nobis
et historicos, in illis operibus oratores aut declamatores imitandos
putemus. Sua cuique proposita lex, suus cuique decor est.’<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> But
the warning was in vain. The historians were still trained in the
rhetor’s school, and the rhetor frequently used historical subjects.
When Ammianus wrote his history, he stood in the great
tradition of Asiatic rhetoric. Thus history continued to wear
the fetters of oratory.</p>

<p>As time went on these fetters became more and more galling.
Just as the Athenians ceased to produce genuine history when
their day of national greatness passed with the failing Empire
and the inefficient democracy, leaving their learning and their
civilization to be overgrown by the weeds of rhetoric and sophistic,
so now the Gauls of the transition choked whatever history there
was with an abundant growth of words. When the panegyric becomes
fashionable in Gaul, we see how history develops into an
instrument of imperial policy. Not merely beauty of form and
the following of traditional rules, but the narrower purpose of
praising the emperor becomes the goal. The facts of history
are loosely and wildly used.<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> Alexander the Great (with the
old argument that he conquered merely ‘imbelles Asiaticos’),
Hannibal, Augustus, are great names for these Epigoni to juggle
with and to mingle promiscuously with the incense of adulation.
Of Caesar it is said: ‘ille Graeculos homines adortus est, tu
(Constantine) Subalpinos’.<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> So far did the travesty of history go.</p>

<p>‘There’, said Eumenius of the Maeniana, ‘let the flower of
our youth learn ... to praise the deeds of the mighty emperors—<i>quis
enim melior usus eloquentiae?</i>’<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> The school must teach them
the proofs, varying with the different places, that establish the
exploits of the prince; and as the news of victory comes hotly in
from time to time, the teacher must point out the land concerned
on the map—the double river of Persia, the parching fields of
Libya, the curving ‘horns’ of the Rhine, the many-flowing
mouths of the Nile. All these several exploits must mould the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
mind of youth to a sense of imperial greatness, while he envisages
the Pax Romana throughout the erstwhile troubled world, ‘for
now, now at length we may look at the map of the world with
joy, seeing in it naught that is foreign’.<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a></p>

<p>This imperialistic use of history made men afraid to tamper
with it, lest indiscretion should mar their fortunes. In the
fifth century there was no longer a Domitian to put historians
to death, but there was a tradition to bind and intimidate.
When Leo, the minister of Euric, advised Sidonius to occupy
himself with history during his banishment, the reply was:
‘turpiter falsa, periculose vera dicuntur’.<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> In this sort of work,
says Sidonius, the mention of the good wins scant credit, the
mention of the great, unbounded enmity. ‘The writing of
history’, he maintains, ‘seems to be the last thing a man of my
class ought to undertake, for to begin it means envy, to continue
it, trouble, and the end of it is hatred.’ The attitude of mind
which made men write to order was spreading: Ausonius is an
outstanding example. At the same time the rhetorical tradition
in history was persisting. Sidonius wants Leo to undertake
a history and the argument for his fitness refers merely to style:
‘nemo te celsius scripserit’.<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a></p>

<p>The all-pervading imperial atmosphere, therefore, was not
encouraging for the historian. We hear of histories begun but
never finished. Symmachus tells of one Protadius, a nobleman,
who set about writing a domestic history.<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> Sidonius had been
asked by Bishop Prosper to write a history of the war with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
Attila, and actually set to work on it but gave it up.<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> It was
not only on the tax-payer that the Empire weighed heavily.</p>

<p>It may be, too, that the emperors interfered with the selection
of the material for the historical course, such as it was. In the
list given by Ausonius (Jung remarks) much stress was laid on
the history of insurrections, and this was done by way of an
object-lesson to the Gauls ‘quo magis rebellionem audientes
detestarentur’.<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> Whether this was actually the case, or whether
the remark is a mere scholastic refinement, we cannot with
certainty say. The imperial authorities were quite capable of
such an act, but, on the other hand, the evidence is not conclusive.
We are inclined to give the emperors the benefit of
the doubt.</p>

<p>With the reaction against the superfluities of rhetoric in the
Christian schools, there followed important results for history.
Christian writers, as we have seen, reinforced and developed,
especially in Gaul, the tendency towards chronography. This
was part of the reaction against the domination of Form in
historical writing, and it proved to be a valuable antidote from
the historian’s point of view. But another and a greater service
resulted. The Christian reaction, as we saw, affected thought
as well as style, and the Christian historians, with their renewed
interest in theology and philosophy, began to look for first
principles in the series of events. The universality of the
Christian religion made them look not only to single nationalities
(though the Church fostered nationalism),<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> but to the whole
world. They tried to see all things in relation to their conception
of the divine. Thus they tended to produce a philosophy
of history, which, though often distorted and biased, set history
on a much more markedly philosophic basis than before. As
instances we may remember Augustine’s <i>City of God</i>, which
was written to justify the fall of Rome, and the universal history
of Orosius (who wrote with far less balance than his master
Augustine), which attempted to prove that ‘there’s a Divinity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
that shapes our ends’. Filled with the same note, and poignantly
real, are the <i>de Providentia Dei</i> and the <i>ad Uxorem</i>,
written in Gaul after the great invasion at the beginning of the
fifth century had forced men to reconsider their philosophy of
life.</p>

<p>We can hardly claim, however, that the Christian elementary
schools were much affected by these contributions of Christianity.
History was still very much of a subsidiary subject and its
standard was low. Yet its extent was widened by the addition
of Bible-history, which often, no doubt, ousted pagan history
altogether; but the interest of men like Augustine in secular
history, and the use they made of it to reinforce Christianity,
would have prevented its disappearance from the more advanced
Christian schools. Bible-history had the advantage, moreover, of
not having an imperial policy behind it, and the greater simplicity
and sincerity of the Christian ideal must have produced something
nearer to historic truth (the absence of which Augustine
deplores in the pagan schools) than the frills and draperies of
rhetoric would generally allow. Bias and misrepresentation,
born of the fervour of conversion, were responsible for a great
many distortions, and the growing formlessness did much
damage to the artistic side of history; but it cannot be denied
that there was a greater desire for truth in the eager questions
of the early Christian than in the smug complacence of the glib
rhetorician.</p>

<p>History, in the hands of a skilful master, may become one of
the very finest instruments of education. It has a legitimate use
in inspiring patriotism. The deeds of a man’s ancestors become
part of his individuality, and may be a source of high and noble
action. Similarly, in proportion as a man realizes his national
unity with his people, their history may become a motive and
a driving force in his life. Now the Roman Empire set before
the schoolboys of Africa and Italy and Gaul the events of the
Roman republic and the deeds of the emperors. But the area
was too wide. The Gallic schoolboy could not feel the value and
the force of things so far distant, different from his own conditions,
and so slightly connected with them. He could not feel
that he was a responsible member of an Empire which could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
defend him. Moreover at this time nationality was coming to be
more and more clearly realized under the influence of the Church:<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a>
each province sought to uphold the specific doctrines of its
leaders, and bishops waged fierce controversial warfare for the
traditions of their country,<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> especially in Africa. There is
a dim individuality to be seen in Spain,<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> and Salvian’s attacks
on the Empire had an aspect which pointed to the beginning of
Gallic nationality. The Roman Empire was beginning to feel
the strain of national individuality. In these circumstances,
history, being hedged in as we have seen by imperial persons and
questions, must have become more and more artificial. The lack
of citizenship which was so prevalent at this time increased for lack
of an inspiring national or international ideal. And such an
ideal might have come partly through a method by which history
would have become more vivid and real to the children in the
schools.</p>

<p>Another possibility that was missed was that of using history
to see the logical and psychological connexion between events.
With the narrow conception of the subject that was entertained
at the time this was impossible. The only sort of causal chain
that the student was induced to see was that, if you did not
please the emperor, so much the worse for you. Not only the
reason, but also the critical faculty, was thus left undeveloped in
this age of adulation and prescription.</p>

<p>In the same way the moral significance of history was overlooked,
and here again the cause was restriction. For in order
to realize the influence of character on the march of events,
a wide, and, if possible, a comparative study of the subject must
be undertaken, and the values attached must not depend on
a gilded imperial figure, but on ethical truth. Again, it was
impossible to judge of the various aims and theories of men in
the past age, to form some sort of opinion of the development
of political theory, to be interested in truth and progress, as
long as rhetoric, the handmaid of a rigid Imperialism, reigned
supreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Position of Greek</span></h3>

<p>When Ephorus called the Celts philhellenes,<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> he was doubtless
thinking of the Greek influence which Massilia (as we have seen)
so effectively spread in Gaul. This influence survived in the
south as late as the seventh century and even later,<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> but
Massilia’s influence had long been waning. During the fourth
and fifth centuries Latin had more and more become the language
of the upper classes,<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> so that the impetus to Greek studies from
this quarter was becoming almost negligible. But tradition still
counted for something. The Aquitanians, who boasted of the
legend which connected their origin with Greece and Bordeaux,
kept up commercial relations with Greece<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> during the fourth
century. It is they who are the most faithful to Greek and
among whom we find most traces of Hellenism.</p>

<p>Now Julian had created a sort of contrast between Greek
learning and Christianity. Hellenism came to be identified with
paganism, and so tended to fall into disrepute as Christianity
gained ground in the fifth century. The inscriptions show
remarkably few traces of Greek. Where they occur they are
usually very short, as in the case of the one found in the Alps
near Vienne and belonging probably to the fourth century:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or else they refer to some foreigner, as the one at Trèves
Οὺρσίκινος ἀνατολικός<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> (i.e. from the land of the rising sun,
eastern), who was probably one of those traders called in a
general way ‘Syrians’.<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> Conrad Celtes speaks of Greek inscriptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
in Gaul which he had seen there in the fifteenth
century:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Graecis vidi epitaphiis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">inscripta busta,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but these could not have been very many. Altogether we have
only nine Greek Christian inscriptions in Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> Nor are the
Greek remains on the pagan side more numerous. That Greek
was declining is abundantly evident from other sources too.
The Greek of Autun in the north shows signs of decadence
even at the end of the third century. But it needed less than
a century for the neglect to spread even to the Grecized south.
Eumenius found it necessary in a formal and imperial speech to
explain the word ‘Musagetes’ to his audience.<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> He himself, of
course, and many of his fellow teachers were familiar with
Greek. Greek forms like ‘Heraclen’, ‘Pythiados’ are often
used, and the orator of Oration VI, who was a Gaul, could quote
Homer.<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> Ausonius says in his quaint mythological style of
Harmonius, professor of Greek at Trèves, that he was the only
one who mingled Greek wine with Italian.<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> But the subject
was fast becoming a schoolmaster’s acquisition. By <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 376 it
was not even that; for the emperors, in speaking of the appointment
of a Greek rhetor, add dubiously ‘if any one worthy of the
post can be found’.<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> It was partly this neglect of Greek, no
doubt, that made Julian refer so often to ἡ τῶν Κέλτων
άγροικία.<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a></p>

<p>As the grandfather of Eumenius was an Attic Greek,<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> we
cannot suppose that it was the un-Greek atmosphere of his surroundings,
but rather personal disinclination or disability that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
allowed Greek to dwindle in the schools. Ausonius says that
his father’s Latin was halting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sermone impromptus Latio, verum Attica lingua</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">suffecit culti vocibus eloquii,<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the verses are a commentary on the swiftness of the decline.
Ausonius himself, in spite of his confession that he neglected
Greek at school,<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> is quite familiar with the language, and loves
to display his knowledge of it—‘magnopere sibi videtur placere
graecissando’.<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> He drags it in pedantically in his epistles and
the capers he cuts with it are merely annoying.<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> But whenever
he addresses the general public he finds it necessary to translate
even the simplest words and phrases, as in the <i>Ludus septem
sapientum</i> when the pantomime player (<i>ludius</i>) speaks.<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> And he
admits that Greek was not very successfully taught, though the
Greek grammarians were industrious enough.<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> There was not
much enthusiasm for the language and its literature, as there
had been in past times. To Citarius, the Sicilian teacher of
Greek, Ausonius says that he would have gained as much glory
for learning as Aristarchus or Zenodotus among the Greeks were
it not that the scale of values had changed.<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a></p>

<p>Still lower did Greek sink in monastic education. There
was opportunity in the south for learning Greek, but it
was exceptional to do so. About the middle of the fifth
century Eugendus came as a scholar to the monastery at
Condat on the Jura mountains, and the record says of him that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
he learned the Greek authors as well as the Latin, <i>such was his
enthusiasm for study</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> But a certain elementary knowledge of
Greek was necessary. The ‘Litterae formatae’, letters of commendation
given to travelling priests by their bishops, according
to the councils of Nicea (325), Laodicea (366), and Milevis (402),
were sometimes drawn up in Greek. The decrees of the bishops
were marked with certain Greek letters to indicate their
authenticity. The work of Dositheus (Ἑρμηνευμάτων libri III),
a sort of motley lexicon interspersed with extracts and dialogues,
chiefly of a juridical character, was used by those who, like the
Northern Gauls, found Greek difficult. We have referred to the
low standard of the Books of Instruction written by Eucherius for
his son Salonius, who was neither very young (about twenty) nor
very stupid (he was made bishop, and could, as we have seen, ask
profound theological questions). As far as the study of language
is concerned, we need to remember that philology is a comparatively
modern science: but such exposition (consisting mostly
of mere translation) as that of talentum, obol, drachma, Theos,
Christus, Hagios, Angelus, &amp;c., under the heading ‘Quaestiones
difficiliores’, must point to a surprising ignorance of Greek even
among the intellectuals of the day.</p>

<p>It was not only in Gaul that schoolboys of that age found
Greek difficult. Augustine had the same trouble in Africa, and
his complaint in the <i>Confessions</i> is well known.<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> He was by
nature romantic, and instinctively hated drudgery. The hateful
repetition of the elementary school ‘unum et unum duo, duo et
duo quattuor’ bored him beyond words. What he liked was to
read about the wanderings of Aeneas and the distress of Dido.
But this was not the whole reason for his difficulty with Greek.
The prevailing conception of discipline made things unpleasant.
He was urged ‘saevis terroribus ac poenis’. Yet this does not
explain the matter, for it applied to Latin as well. He himself
could hardly understand what was wrong. Why should he have
hated Greek so much? ‘Quid autem erat causae cur Graecas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
litteras oderam quibus puerulus imbuebar, nec nunc quidem exploratum
est’;<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> and again ‘Cur ergo Graecam ... grammaticam
oderam?’<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> The difference between Greek and Latin could not
lie in the different material of the books read, because they were
Vergil and Homer; and if he liked Aeneas why did he not like
Odysseus?</p>

<p>Rocafort,<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> in his study of the life of Paulinus of Pella, is
struck with the extent of Greek in the curriculum of the
Bordeaux schools. ‘Here too we must note how great a place
was given to Greek literature in that scheme of studies. For
from the Greek poets, orators, and philosophers the children
learnt poetry, eloquence, and philosophy at one and the same
time as from the Latin; or rather, they learnt from the Greek
first. To such an extent had the conquered captured the conqueror....
Of the public schools in Gaul, not a single one
neglected Greek (<i>publicarum scholarum, quae in illa provincia</i>
(Gallia) <i>erant, non fuit una in qua Graecae litterae neglectae
fuerint</i>). The schoolboys of that time, he argues, must have been
well versed in Greek ‘because in the schooldays of Ausonius
there were those who could compare the Greek verses of the
schoolmaster Citarius with those of Simonides, and the Greek
speeches of Urbicus, also a schoolmaster, with those of Ulysses
and Nestor’.<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a></p>

<p>But the author forgets that the official acceptance of a tradition,
the mere inclusion of Greek-texts in the syllabus, the
mere following out of the traditional order, does not indicate
thoroughness or efficiency. Paulinus talks of studying ‘dogmata
Socratus’ at the age of five, but this does not mean that the
wealth of Greek philosophy was opened up for the scholar.
Indeed, we have evidence that the reverse was the case. And
where we learn from both scholars and teachers (as we do) that
the results of Greek study were barren and fruitless, it is surely
wrong to draw from the prominence of Greek books in the
school the inference that Greek studies were in a flourishing
state. Moreover, if Paulinus seems to have appreciated his
Greek, we must remember that he was born at Pella, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
when he came to Gaul the household servants habitually spoke
Greek to him.<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> He is therefore a special case in the sense that
Greek was his mother-tongue. The fact that the literary products
of Citarius and Urbicus were compared to those of great
men need not mean anything. We have seen with what elaborate
and artificial courtesy the ‘litterati’ of Gaul treated one another at
this time. They called one another Ciceros and Vergils on the
slightest provocation.<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> As for the argument that Greek was
taught first, it may appear that this was to its detriment rather
than in its interest. The quite abnormal difficulty which
Augustine found in learning the new language (he compares
it to gall embittering the sweetness of the poem) is not explained.</p>

<p>Nor can we very well account for Augustine’s distaste for the
language by reference to national antipathies. ‘He detested the
Greeks by instinct’, says M. Bertrand.<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> ‘According to Western
prejudice, these men of the East were all rascals or amusers.
Augustin, as a practical African, always regarded the Greeks as
vain, discoursing wits.... The entirely local patriotism of the
classical Greek authors further annoyed this Roman citizen, who
was used to regard the world as his country: he thought them
very narrow-minded to take so much interest in the history of
some little town.... It must be remembered that in the second
half of the fourth century the Greek attitude ... set itself more
and more against Latinism, above all, politically.’ This may be
all very well for the educated citizen who could appreciate the
considerations of politics and cosmopolitanism, but it hardly
applies to the time of life at which we find the complaints
against Greek, namely childhood. What we should expect from
this thesis is that in later life, with a fuller realization of these
things, the men of the West would have shunned Greek. Yet
we know that it was precisely then that Ausonius took to Greek,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
and Augustine, judging from his frequent references to Greek
authors, must have done the same.</p>

<p>We need some other explanation, and we begin to find one
when we realize that it was not so much the intrinsic difficulty
of Greek as the way of teaching the <i>second language</i> that
was the real problem. The relation of the one to the other is
pronounced unsatisfactory by Paulinus of Pella, who was educated
at Bordeaux. He complains that this ‘double learning’ is all
very well for the more powerful minds to whom it gives a
‘double glory’, but in the case of the duller boy like himself this
scheme is too difficult.<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a></p>

<p>A proof of this unsatisfactory training we find in the verses
he writes. There are many <i>anacolutha</i>, and, as his editor
Brandes remarks, ‘metricae artis ita expertem se praestiterit ut
nullam paginam foedis maculis non conspergeret’,<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> though much
of this must be attributed to the illness which put a stop to his
studies at fifteen,<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> just when he was beginning to make good
progress.<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a></p>

<p>What, then, exactly was wrong with the teaching of the second
language? Partly it undoubtedly was (as has been indicated)
that stupid concentration on the dry bones of grammar which
persists up to the present day in the teaching of a strange
language. The assumption is that learning a language must
necessarily be a synthetic process in which you pass from the
details to the whole, instead of being rather analytic, a process
in which you pass from an appreciation of the general rhythm
and sense and structure to the details of construction, which only
have a meaning in so far as they are related to the larger thing.
But there was a deeper cause. Augustine gets the root of the
matter when he says that it was <i>unnaturalness</i>. The reason why
Latin was not to him the drudgery that Greek was lay in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
fact that it came to him naturally and easily and pleasantly,
‘inter blandimenta nutricum et ioca arridentium et laetitias
alludentium’. He learnt with an interest that was natural and
delightful ‘not from lessons but from conversations with those
in whose ears I longed to pour out all I felt’. It is interest and
not force that produces the best results. ‘Hinc satis elucet’, he
says, ‘maiorem habere vim ad discenda ista liberam curiositatem
quam meticulosam necessitatem.’</p>

<p>Now naturalness means giving scope to the individuality, and
developing that sane curiosity which can be elicited by proper
methods from every child. Its practice in education, therefore,
must mean a protest against the militaristic disciplinarian, and
as such Augustine mainly intended it. But it contains, also,
a reproof for the thoughtless and unscientific teacher who regards
the child as a receptacle for external and ready-made ideas,
a protest against the spiritual militarist who does not start with
what there is in the child’s mind, but begins by introducing
alien matter and perverting the natural resources.</p>

<p>This was exactly what Roman education had always done.
It had taken the Latin-speaking child, and, instead of starting
with his knowledge of Latin, it began as a rule by cramming
in a foreign language, Greek. When Augustine speaks of the
Greek studies ‘quibus puerulus imbuebar’,<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> he is merely affirming
that his school followed the ordinary Roman tendency to put
Greek first. Greek influence had early captured the Roman
schools, and had been widely spread at various times by Scipio
and his circle,<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> by Hadrian,<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> and by Julian. That easy acceptance
of the Greek example, especially in matters of culture,
which Plutarch notices,<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> called for the strong protest of patriots
like Cicero on more than one occasion.<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> But here, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
matter of rhetoric, the protest was unavailing. We can trace the
hellenizing influence as the Empire goes on. Pliny is quite ready
to admit the charge of ‘egestas patrii sermonis’ which Cicero is
always denying,<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> and Seneca writes at length on the subject
(<i>Quanta verborum nobis paupertas</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> To a certain extent, of
course, this was true, but it is the spirit of the writer that is
significant. Whereas Cicero tried to coin philosophical terms<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> to
enrich his language, the later writers merely criticize, or advocate
the substitution of Greek. Suetonius quotes Cicero’s letter to
Titinius: ‘I remember how, in our boyhood, a certain Plotius
was the first to teach Latin. He obtained numbers of pupils ...
and I grieved that I could not go too. But I was restrained by
the opinion of the experts who thought that the intellect could
be better nourished by a Greek training.’<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> How far national
pride had declined is indicated by a comparison of Cicero’s <i>Dream
of Scipio</i> which Macrobius has preserved for us, and the notes of
the commentator. In Cicero’s text the heaven depicted is pre-eminently
for patriots; in Macrobius’s commentary entry into
public life is a hindrance rather than a help.<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> And the failure
of patriotism meant increased readiness to adopt and ape the
foreign thing simply because it was foreign. It meant that
education came to be identified with a knowledge of Greek.</p>

<p>Pliny, in spite of his leaning to Hellenism, complained that in
the legal profession young men begin with the civil suits of the
centumviral court, just as in the schools they begin with Homer,<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a>
and his comment is in the nature of a criticism: ‘For here, as
there, they start with what is most difficult.’ Suetonius<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> indicates
the Greek tradition in Roman education when he says that
grammar at first made no great progress, since the first teachers,
who were at once poets and semi-Greeks, explained none but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
Greek authors to their pupils, merely reading out to them an
occasional Latin composition of their own. And Julius Capitolinus
in the life of Maximinus Junior<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> mentions the Greek
training and the Greek grammarian in such a way as to indicate
that Greek was taught first. This is distinctly maintained by
Petronius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">Det primos versibus annos</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Maeoniumque bibat felici pectore fontem.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Homer and Socrates and Demosthenes come first: then Latin
literature adds the final flavour. Finally, it was Quintilian’s
injunction that the orator must begin his education with Homer.<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a>
Jung thinks that Latin and Greek were probably taught together;
but he bases his argument on the slender proof that
Crispus and Urbicus are called ‘Grammatici Latini et Graeci’.<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a></p>

<p>This strong tradition was adopted in Gaul, largely, no doubt,
on the authority of Quintilian. Paulinus, who went through
the regular school-course at Bordeaux, started with ‘dogmata
Socratus (Σωκράτους) et bellica plasmata Homeri’.<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> In Ausonius’s
scheme of studies for his grandson, Homer and Menander came
first.<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> And Jerome advises this order for the education of Laeta’s
little daughter: ‘ediscat Graecorum versuum (of the Bible)
numerum: sequatur statim Latina eruditio.’<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> ‘L’Hellénisme’,
says Jullian<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> of the Bordeaux schools, ‘est la sauvegarde des
esprits et le salut des âmes. C’est l’idéal de l’École,’ and again,
‘les œuvres d’Homère étaient les premières livres qu’on mettait
aux mains d’un enfant, qu’il fût Grec ou Romain.’</p>

<p>This is the point, ‘Greek <i>or</i> Roman’. Educational experience
has shown that a school-system must be elastic and accommodate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
itself to the psychology and the needs of the child. Wherever
there have been bilingual countries the problem has arisen.
What is educationally the soundest principle of manipulating the
language question? At first it was thought that the language
of the higher culture should be enforced on all. It would save
time and expense and trouble; moreover (so men argued), it
would be in the interest of the child whose mother-tongue was
thus disregarded, for he would have so much more time to learn
the language of the ‘superior culture’. Your own language,
they told the other party, you know already and your children
need not spend time on it at school. Better, therefore, to have
a uniform language throughout.</p>

<p>Now such a course (looking at it from the educational point
of view) has been proved over and over again to be utterly
unsound. The verdict of history has been to uphold, even at
the cost of money and time and trouble, the principle of mother-tongue
instruction. You must, as Augustine implied, start with
what is natural to the child. If you begin with what is strange
and has no connexion with his thoughts and speech, you are
merely delaying his progress. You will, no doubt, develop his
memory, but his thought will remain untouched. Inspectors in
the schools of South Africa have reported repeatedly the case of
Dutch children who have been started on English, that they
read and spell perfectly, but are quite unable to explain the
meaning of an English sentence. The consequence is that they
take twice as long to pass the elementary standards as they
normally would. The same has been found in Quebec and in
India and Burma. Teachers and missionaries everywhere have
discovered that the mother-tongue principle is the only fruitful one.
They have found that where it is applied progress follows in an
unexpected way. Once the child has learned to use, to analyse,
to understand his own language, once his thought has been set
going, he will learn the second language more quickly than the
child who started with the second language. He is therefore
ahead in three respects: his thought has been stimulated, he has
learned his own language, he has learned another language,
whereas the other has not been induced to think, knows his own
language superficially and the second language imperfectly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
This can be substantiated by many cases from the experience of
teachers in bilingual countries.</p>

<p>May we not, then, find the ultimate cause of the failure of
Greek in the schools of our period, in this mistaken policy of
starting with the second language? At a time when Latin was
becoming more and more the household tongue of Gaul, and
Greek proportionately strange, the effect of beginning with the
latter could not but lead to sterile results. There seems to have
been an idea, which we find also in Jung,<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> that they should clear
the second language out of the way first, ‘quo postea linguam
suam plenius ac melius ... ediscerent’. They seem to have
thought that whatever you learn last has the strongest influence,
and therefore, if you <i>must</i> learn Greek, do so first, lest it mar
your Latin. How far this peculiarly Roman and unpsychological
attitude failed is a question which needs no further comment.</p>

<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Art</span></h3>

<p>In a survey of Gallic education art must be mentioned, but
the space given to it must of necessity be very limited. Only
in its possible effect on education can it be briefly touched on,
and even then not as a school-subject, but rather as an influence
behind official teaching.</p>

<p>The Gauls were by nature fond of art. That eager curiosity
and excitability which Caesar noticed<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> in them were the basis
of an artistic temperament. Ausonius, in his epigrams, refers
frequently to works of art,<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> and his enthusiasm over the sculptured
calf of Myron is remarkable.<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> He maintains the advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
doctrine that art is greater than nature. Of Myron’s heifer
he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fingere nam similem vivae, quam vivere, plus est;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">nec sunt facta dei mira, sed artificis.<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the ‘poems added by Thaddaeus Ugoletus to the epigrams
of Ausonius’ the same statue is referred to in three epigrams,<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a>
and we have one ‘on the marble statue of Niobe’, expressing
a certain amount of artistic appreciation. We hear of one of
Sidonius’s friends who was a student of Vitruvius,<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> and Patiens
was much interested in the adornment of the churches of Lyons.</p>

<p>But there were two considerations that affected this natural
love of art in the Gauls: the Roman element in them, and the
fact that art, like literature, was becoming a matter of form.
Just as beauty of style had once been a living and inspiring
thing to the Greeks, but became in our period a juggling with
phrase and rule, so art had lost its true and inner meaning. And
just as the Greek influence of Massilia had encouraged the
artistic instinct of the Gauls, so the harder Roman spirit proved
an impediment. Sidonius illustrates this fact admirably. Surrounded
by all the luxury of his time, he felt bound to include
art products among his possessions, and liked to talk about them,
with the comfortable assurance that it was a respectable and
cultured thing to do. But he shows little real appreciation.
Purgold has shown<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> that most of the descriptions in his poems
referring to art are borrowed from Claudian and other Roman
poets. In his account of the castle of Pontius Leontius we have
a list of artistic productions<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> in the usual Roman encyclopaedic
style, and similarly his acquaintance with sculpture is merely
conventional. He knows the stock attitudes that sculptors give
to philosophers,<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> and this is the order of his artistic attainments.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
In describing the churches of Patiens at Lyons<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a> and of Perpetuus
at Tours,<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> he is much more interested in the inscriptions<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> he
wrote for them than in the architecture. And this in spite of
the fact that Perpetuus had employed a style in rebuilding the
church at Tours in 470 which was new to Gaul, and had introduced
a form of choir which was the point of departure from which
the ‘chevet’ of French, Romanesque, and Gothic architecture
developed.<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> This lack of appreciation was part of the general
decline in art at this time. In the triumphal arch of Constantine
(early fourth century) part of the design is inserted from the
arch of Trajan, and has, therefore, little original artistic value,
while the other part, which is contemporary, illustrates the decay
of aesthetic taste. Similarly, the contemporary part of the
discus of Theodosius is merely profuse and conventional.<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a></p>

<p>Art in Gaul, as at Rome, was largely produced by foreigners.
The great statue of Mercury of Auvergne, the only Gallic piece
of sculpture we know, was executed by the Greek Zenodorus, who
sold his work for 400,000 sesterces, and was then called to Rome
to make a statue of Nero. Of the statues found at Martres, near
Toulouse, the oldest belonged to the first century, the more
recent to the third and fourth. Why is it that so many were
found in the same place? Lavisse thinks that the Christians,
in the height of their anti-pagan fury, collected, mutilated, and
threw them together in some out-of-the-way spot. Now it is
commonly held, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> that the sort of marble of
which they were made is the same as that of the neighbouring
quarries, especially that of Saint-Béat on the Upper Garonne.
It is therefore probable that they were produced in the neighbourhood,
and the thought is suggested that perhaps, for all
we know, they may represent some school of sculptors which
flourished during our period. Of Gallic sculpture and its relation
to Greek art, the influence of Alexandria, the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
Hellenistic art in the first century, the industrial art of Gaul
and its relation to Greece, a sound and recent summary will be
found in Lavisse.<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a></p>

<p>The splendour of public buildings both at Trèves and at
Autun is often expatiated on by the panegyrists.<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> The descriptions
show considerable interest in architecture, and this
interest when presented externally in a building like the Maeniana
must have had an educative value for those who attended the
institution. But it was Christianity that accomplished most in
this field. When Christian art began to develop it took for its
first church model the basilica which was already seen in the
chapels of the catacombs. We hear of bishops of Gaul who got
workmen to come over from Italy in order to build churches
after this style. The basilicas of Constantine and Theodosius,
the sepulchral bas-reliefs at Rome, Ravenna, and Arles, and at
many other places, are well known. ‘Before the fall of the
Empire’, says Ozanam, ‘there was to be seen that Romanesque
and Byzantine architecture which was soon to cover with monuments
the shores of the Loire, Seine and Rhine, and which, from
the broken arch of its vault, was to produce all the beauties of
the pointed Gothic.’<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> That the interest which Sidonius and his
friends showed (though superficially) in architecture did not die
with them is proved by the letter of Cassiodorus (at the beginning
of the sixth century) to the prefect of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> He is
anxious to have a competent man in charge of the public architecture.
‘Romanae fabricae decus convenit peritum habere
custodem’, who must be an expert and a student: ‘Det operam
libris antiquorum, instructionibus vacet.’ There were within the
church a large number of narrow and uneducated zealots, who,
like Martin of Tours, banished all art. ‘Ars ibi’, says Sulpicius
Severus of Martin’s monastery, ‘exceptis scriptoribus, nulla
habebatur.’<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> Even the books were assigned only to the younger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
brethren: ‘maiores orationi vacabant’. In his theory of education
Augustine allows pictures and statues and such-like to be
used for instruction. But, except for strictly scientific purposes,
they must be looked on as otiose: ‘hoc totum genus inter
superflua hominum instituta numerandum est, nisi cum interest
quid eorum, qua de causa, et ubi et quando et cuius auctoritate
fiat.’ Cassiodorus expresses the view of the more liberal and
enlightened Christian teachers when he sees that art may be
used to improve the works of the ancients by avoiding their
mistakes, to clothe the new in the glory of the old.<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> Similarly
in Paulinus of Nola we find the motto of ‘Spoiling the Egyptians’
in regard to art, and the note of ‘Soli Deo gloria’. To art
conceived in this way he has no objection; rather, he seeks it
out with enthusiastic eagerness. ‘Videamus autem aedificantes
quid de nostra fragili terrenaque substantia dignum divino
fundamento superaedificare possimus, ut ipso principali lapide
unificati lapides in fabricam templi caelestis optemur.’<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> Thus,
while there was much in the conception of Christianity at the
time which made for a philistinism in art, there were also encouraging
elements.</p>

<p>In the catacombs, too, we find traces of other artistic developments.
Ignorant and untrained as those early Christians were,
they had within them a strong emotion based on sincere conviction,
and this emotion found an outlet in verse and painting,
sculpture and mosaic, which, though often of the most rudimentary
order, represented the beginnings of new artistic
movements. A glass patera found at Cologne has gold figures
on a white background, representing the vision of Ezekiel, and
it belongs to the first few centuries of our era.<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> Gilt glasses,
frequently produced at Cologne, and decorated with the heads of
Christ and the apostles, have come down to us from the early
Christian centuries. There are also finely wrought and figured
lamps and linens. But most striking are the ivories, of which
a large number is now in the British museums. They are
extremely beautiful and belong to a school of the fourth and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
fifth centuries. Pilate washing his hands, Peter’s denial, Judas
hanging himself, Christ bearing the Cross—such are the themes
portrayed on them, possibly by Eastern carvers.<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> At Arles there
is a large collection of paintings which show that the passage of
the Red Sea was a favourite subject. And Paulinus of Nola, in
his long letter to Severus,<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> shows clearly that it was a common
thing to have paintings in the churches. He describes the
prominent picture of Martin, ‘qui etiam in splendoribus sanctorum
conspicua claritate praefulget’, and mentions another of
himself on an adjoining wall. Numerous verses are addressed to
Severus on the subjects of his pictures, and his skill is praised
as worthy of his themes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Digna sacramentis gemina sub imagine pinxit.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He describes various church pictures representing the Trinity,
the Good Shepherd, the Baptism of Christ, the Crucifixion,<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> and
so on, in the church of Nola. Similarly the pictures in the
church of Fundana are described. The elaboration of the scene
strikes us as a harbinger of mediaeval art. In a single picture
we have the themes of God in paradise, Christ and the Cross,
the Spirit and the Father crowning Him, and the Day of
Judgement.<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a></p>

<p>This elaboration is found, too, in the architecture and in the
general adornment of the churches. Paulinus describes arches,
chambers, fonts, &amp;c., in detail, as, for instance, those of the
church at Nola.<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>Similarly the church at Fundana is described.<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> Now the
church was the place where the mass of the people met, and if
we must recognize it at this time as the religious, the moral, and
the intellectual teacher of the people, we must also recognize in
its training, to some extent, an element of artistic education.</p>

<p>But the form of art that was most commonly cultivated by
the men of this time was music. There is an epitaph of Vienne
to one Nicias a citharoedus,<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> and another of Nemausum to
Avidius Secundus, a maker of musical instruments (<i>musicarius</i>).<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>
Gaul had inherited all the musical devices and appliances of
Rome, and like Rome had used them chiefly for frivolous
pleasures. But Sidonius notes that Theodoric II cared only for
serious music. Hydraulic organs and dancing girls he dispensed
with.<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> Still more did the Christians dispense with such things.
But if they would not and could not develop the instrumental
side, they certainly made a speciality of singing. There is
a doubtful but interesting legend which says that when the
Empress Justina threatened to deliver the basilica of Milan to
the Arians, Ambrose and his congregation spent a day and
a night in the building. To pass the time he introduced hymn-tunes,
already adopted by the Eastern Church. Augustine testifies
to the impression which these hymns made on him at Milan.
They were the means of bringing the truth home to him.
‘Quantum flevi in hymnis et cantibus tuis, suave sonantis
ecclesiae tuae vocibus commotus acriter! Voces illae influebant
auribus meis et eliquabatur veritas in cor meum, et exaestuabat
inde affectus pietatis, et currebant lacrimae, et bene mihi erat
cum eis.’<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> He had doubts at first as to the propriety of such
sense-seducing music, but his scruples did not long survive. He
himself showed considerable interest in the art and wrote six
books <i>De Musica</i> in a didactic strain.</p>

<p>Nor was the interest confined to him. Everywhere in the
Christian schools choristers were trained. Jerome speaks of
hymn-singing or chants in the schools, where the little ones
sing of Pharaoh’s disaster in the Red Sea and the triumph of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
the just.<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> Claudianus Mamertus trained a choir for his brother,
the Bishop of Vienne<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> (<i>instructas docuit sonare classes</i>). Antiphonal
singing (i.e. the older practice of the alternate singing
of psalms) is often mentioned. Sidonius speaks of the monks
and priests who chant psalms with alternating sweetness,<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> and
we have seen how Caesarius, when he became bishop, made his
congregation sing in this way. In the clerical training singing
came to be very important. It was forbidden by Gregory to
take orders without it. Columban complains of the harsh discipline
which accompanied it.<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a></p>

<p>The beginnings of hymn-singing in this period have a
particular interest for Gaul because they are connected with
Hilary of Poitiers. We have Jerome’s statement ‘Hilarius in
hymnorum carmine Gallos indociles vocat’,<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> which seems to
mean more than the remark he makes elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> that among
the works of Hilary was <i>Liber hymnorum et mysteriorum</i>. For
it suggests that Hilary tried to introduce hymn-singing into
Gaul and did not meet with great success. This is supported
by the definite statement of Isidore of Seville ‘Hymnorum
carmine (Hilarius) floruit <i>primus</i>’.<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> With Ambrose, Hilary
shares the distinction of being a pioneer in this department.
So important was their work that the Fourth Council of Toledo
(633) in its Thirteenth Canon referred to their hymns (‘quos
beatissimi doctores Hilarius atque Ambrosius ediderunt’). These
hymns were regarded as having a sort of direct spiritual
influence which effected the routing of a personal devil<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a>—a conception<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
which appears throughout the Middle Ages and in
<i>Faust</i>. But they had their value for literature as well. Apart
from the beauty of some of Ambrose’s hymns, the metres which
they popularized formed a point from which the development of
specifically modern metres can be traced. The influence of these
hymns which the mass of the people, unprejudiced by an elaborate
training in classical metres, daily heard and sang, must have
been enormous in forming a public opinion on the technique of
poetry. For there are few things that grip the popular imagination
more than tunes of this kind.</p>

<p>Bulaeus<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> states that Nicetius, Bishop of Lyons in the latter
half of the sixth century, was the first to introduce hymn-singing
into the church at Lyons. He refers to the epitaph which we
find in the Bollandist records:<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Psallere praecepit, normamque tenere canendi</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>primus</i> et alterutrum tendere voce chorum.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the reference of Sidonius, quoted above,<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> to the choir-singing
in the church of Lyons in the fifth century, makes it
probable that what is here referred to is either a revival of the
old part-singing which had become usual in Hilary’s time, or
else some specialized form of chant which was slightly different
from the ordinary style. In any case we may safely conclude
that Gaul played no unimportant part in the development of
church-singing during the fourth century.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DECLINE OF EDUCATION</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Gallic Students Abroad</span></h3>

<p>We have traced the main branches of study that were pursued
in Gaul, and the question naturally arises: ‘How far did the
Gauls give and receive education outside the boundaries of their
country?’</p>

<p>Modern parallels suggest, at first sight, that a liberal education
would not have been considered complete in the provinces unless
the student had attended the imperial universities. But Gaul
at this time held so prominent a position in the educational and
political world that the analogy fails. The professors appointed,
both in Gaul and elsewhere, were frequently men who had had
all their education in that province. There is no trace that
Ausonius ever studied at Rome or Constantinople: he came into
contact with the imperial house while studying at Toulouse,
where Constantine’s brothers were staying.<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> Minervius<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> was a
popular teacher at Rome and at Constantinople, where Arborius
also was famous as a rhetor.<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> The son of Sedatus, rhetor at
Toulouse, taught at Rome:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Et tua nunc suboles morem sectata parentis,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Narbonem ac Romam nobilitat studiis.<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even the poor Victorius went to Sicily and to Cumae, presumably
to study and to teach,<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> while Dynamius became a
rhetor in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> To some extent that wandering and eclectic
spirit of learning which broke out anew in the movement that
has been called ‘Die zweite Sophistik’, and which appears in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
the professors and students of Philostratus, Lucian, and Apuleius,
was still operative. But more important was the prominence
of Gallic studies which not only created a demand for the
teachers of Gaul in Rome and Constantinople, but drew men
from Sicily<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a> for the comparatively unimportant position of
grammarian.</p>

<p>Yet there was a certain number of Gallic students who went
to study at Rome, chiefly in jurisprudence. It was there that
Ambrose, born in all probability at Trèves about 340, studied law.</p>

<p>Of the conditions under which he and students like him studied
the Theodosian Code has much to say. The decree of Valens and
Gratian in 370<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> prescribed that any provincial student who wanted
to take a course at Rome must apply for leave to the provincial
judges, and must, on his arrival in Rome, show his letter of permission,
which mentioned the town to which the student belonged,
his relations, and connexions, to the Master of the Census. The
regulation about getting special permission from the governors
of the provinces is an instance of the usual coercion of the
individual in the Roman Empire; but it is also based on the
rigid economic system of the emperors, and it may have had its
good side in preventing students from coming over too young.
Of a piece with it, and illustrating the utilitarianism of the
Roman mind, is the rule that no one may remain in Rome as
a student after the age of twenty, for no one must escape the
public burdens longer than that (‘ne diutius his patria defraudetur,
muneraque adeo publica declinent’).<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a></p>

<p>During the student’s residence in the imperial city he stood
under strict supervision and drastic discipline. He must state
clearly what his special subject is so as to waste no time, and
the Censuales must know where he lives and keep an eye on his
studies. His public conduct and associations are carefully
watched. Shows, theatres, and late banquets are specially mentioned
as snares and delusions in the path of youth. Any one
who behaves in unseemly fashion is to be publicly whipped and
shipped home to his province. So far did the coercive Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
spirit in education go. For the Romans always looked on education
as a discipline which must serve some external end, and
not (like the Greeks) as a development of the human spirit
valuable for its own sake.</p>

<p>But while we cannot justify this drastic interference with
individual development, we must remember that the strictness
of the moral discipline was probably wholesome and necessary.
The state of Rome, which Ammianus twice in his history describes
with considerable care,<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> and the account which Augustine
gives of the ‘eversores’, or bands of rowdy students,<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> in the
contemporary African schools of rhetoric warrant such a supposition.
We must reflect, moreover, that the custom and
temptations of life in a metropolis were probably new to most of
the provincial students and apt to have disconcerting results.</p>

<p>There is a curious inscription of Lyons which bears on the
question of Gallic students abroad. It reads as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Memoriae A. Vitelli Valeri</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hic annorum X in studiis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Romae de(cessit) parentes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nymphi(us) et Tyche</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">uni(co) et carissimo fil(io).<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is evident that the translation must be something like this:
‘To the memory of Aulus Vitellius Valerius. He died at the
age of ten while studying at Rome. His parents Nymphius and
Tyche (set up this stone) to their beloved and only son.’ But how
a boy of Lyons could reasonably be a student in Rome at the
age of ten is less clear. We may arrive at an explanation by supposing
that ‘X’ is wrong; more especially as the editors quarrel
over it, some omitting it altogether, while others find a variant
reading. On this assumption the only way of making it fit in
with the facts known about Gallic students at Rome is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
read ‘XX’. The student would then have come over at the usual
age, and have been in the last year of his studies at the time of
his death. If the reading ‘X’ is adhered to, on the grounds that
it is much the clearest, we suggest that ‘in studiis’ here means
in the office of the imperial secretary ‘a studiis’, who did
researches for the emperor when he had a difficult rescript to
compose involving historical or legal research, and that the boy
was a sort of Bodleian boy employed in fetching and carrying
books.<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> It is not inconceivable, however, that he may merely
have been sent to a grammarian at Rome as a sort of junior
boarder.</p>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Invaders</span></h3>

<p>But in spite of the extent and the fame of Gallic studies
there come to us, every now and then, hints of decadence in
education. The fourth-century Ammianus says that even the
few homes in which the studious atmosphere of earlier days had
survived were in his day given over to vanity. All they abound
in is the trifling of sluggish idleness, while they resound with voices
and the wind-borne tinkling of the lute. The singer replaces
the philosopher, and instead of the orator they summon the
actor to give them amusement.<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a> In the fifth century we
find Sidonius frequently referring to the decline of culture,<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> and
Paulinus of Pella says of his former studies that they have all
ceased to flourish, because, as all know, they have fallen on evil
days.<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> Claudianus Mamertus, in the letter to the learned
Sapaudus, after a eulogy on Greece as ‘Disciplinarum omnium
atque artium magistra’, uses strong language about the failing
culture of his age: ‘Bonarum artium ... facta iactura, et animi
cultum despuens’, ‘deliciis et divitiis serviens et ignaviae et<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
inscitiae famula’, ‘pessum dedit cum doctrina virtutem’.<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> There
is no progress and creative genius: hardly any one wants to
learn. It cannot be, he reflects, that the nature of the human
mind changes: history testifies to the contrary. No, the truth
is that there is no enthusiasm or application. ‘Nostro saeculo
non ingenia deesse, sed studia.’ A mark of decadence is the
barbarization of the Latin language.<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> Barbarism and solecism
are the tyrants that reign. Rhetoric (conceived in the Ciceronian
sense) is too big for the petty compass of these present-day
Epigoni. Music, geometry, and arithmetic call forth only their
violent hate, and philosophy is utterly despised. The emphasis
laid on oratory makes us suspect that the truth of some of his
statements rather suffers from that ‘declamationum suavitas’
which he finds in Sapaudus.<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a> But in the main he was undoubtedly
right. No matter how enthusiastic the fifth-century
‘litterati’ were about letters, the stern march of economic and
political events inevitably made for a decline. At the end of
the fourth and the beginning of the fifth century the Salian
Franks, who were destined to conquer Gaul, were established
in Toxandria in the north; and in ceasing to recognize the
supremacy of Rome they slipped away from Roman civilization
and from Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> In the south the Goths were settled
in the second Aquitaine and Toulouse under their own king
in 419, and the step was significant of the decentralization of the
Empire. More and more the Teutonic element encroached. ‘The
process of history in the Western Empire during the period
which lies between the death of Alaric (410) and the fall of
Romulus Augustulus (476) is toward the establishment of
Teutonic Kingdoms.’<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> However imperialistic Gaul might be,
the Goths in the south-west, the Franks in the north, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
Burgundians in Savoy, the Alemanni on the upper Rhine, and
the Alani at Valence and Orleans in the middle years of the
fifth century proved an effective barrier to the direct advance of
Roman civilization. This civilization might advance, ultimately,
<i>through</i> the barbarians: but meantime there was a transition
period in which the shock of nations produced confusion and
darkness. Euric aspired to dominion over Gaul, and by 476 he
had attained his desire.</p>

<p>But more direct in their effect upon education than these
large political movements, and swifter than the ‘barbarization’
of Latin as it passed into the Romance languages, were the
invasions. Pagan and Christian alike testify to their horror.
Rutilius Namatianus gives us a description of Gaul, piteously
defaced by long wars, when he returned thither in 416 after
having been prefect at Rome.</p>

<p class="noindent">Added to these troubles from without was the internal commotion
caused by robber bands like the notorious Bagaudae,
who, in spite of periodical repressions,<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> continued to exist.<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> So
formidable were they that in 407 Sarus, the general of Honorius,
was obliged to buy from them his passage into Italy with a rich
portion of spoil.<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> The oppression of officials swelled their ranks,<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a>
and in the middle of the fifth century they established a commonwealth
which took a prominent part in the fighting in Spain at
that time. Thus they were a constant source of disturbance, and
the prolongation of this unrest is mirrored in the pages of
Sidonius. In a letter to Lupus,<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> he tells of a woman who has
been carried away by bandits, the local Vargi who were the
spiritual descendants of the Bagaudae. The attacks of the
Goths towards the end of the fifth century made travelling
dangerous, and Sidonius postpones writing to Eutropius on this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
account.<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> He sends his messenger only after he hears that ‘the
treaty-breaking race’ (<i>foedifragam gentem</i>) has returned within
its borders. We hear of a man who had fled with his family into
the diocese of Bishop Censorius ‘depredationis Gothicae turbinem
vitans’. Sidonius asks Censorius to treat him indulgently and
to remit the glebe-dues in his case, so that he may have the
whole harvest for himself.<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> And so it went on. There were
constant disputes,<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> and whenever there was an invasion the
Arvernians suffered: ‘huic semper irruptioni nos miseri Arverni
ianua sumus.’<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a></p>

<p>We can hardly wonder that this constant unrest made men
despair of final peace. Avitus, Bishop of Vienne, writes to
Aurelian in a pessimistic strain.<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> The evils of the time, he
thinks, are not really healed. At best they cannot be said to
be more than kept within bounds, so that the peace which
coyly appears is fictitious. The mind is lulled to rest with
a false security only until there comes the recrudescence of a
worse fear and the faltering sobs of grief. ‘Wherefore, my
good friend, cease to hope for the end of our evils in the
midst of fiery ills, and when a change comes and the storm
has abated and the face of ever so small a calm shows itself,
do not delight in the altered events; make use of them.’</p>

<p>The effect of this upon the social fabric, and so on education,
is obvious. Even if, as Freeman thinks, the youth of Gaul
were not much concerned in the defence of their country,
which was left mainly to such allies as the Franks,<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> education
must have shared in the general disorganization of society.
The material means of instruction was frequently removed by
the impoverishment of families.</p>

<p class="noindent">The roads, which had promoted education by linking up towns
and spreading civilization, were now (as we have seen) uncertain
and unsafe. Centres, consequently, which had previously teemed

books were neglected.</p>

<p class="noindent">Yet there is the spark which kept alive the flickering torch of

<p>There is much of rude and rushing violence in this ‘barbarization’
of Gaul. One of the writers likened it to a flood,
and as far as the time at which he wrote is concerned he was
right. But, regarded as a whole, the process was gradual and
persistent. Gaul became de-Romanized ‘not as a valley is
ravaged by a torrent, but as the most solid substance is disorganized
by the continual infiltration of a foreign substance’.<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a>
So Rutilius says of Rome, referring to Stilicho’s German
followers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ipsa satellitibus pellitis Roma patebat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">et captiva prius quam caperetur erat.<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>But subtler still than gradual infiltration of foreigners in
producing the decline of culture were the ideas and ideals that
lay at the root of the imperial and the rhetorical systems.
While on the one hand the Empire made the schools of Gaul
its proper care, it was, by its economic system, calling into
life the subversive power of Bagaudae bands.<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a></p>

<p>While the schools were fostering education and creating a
love of learning, they were at the same time killing the true
spirit of education by the methods they employed. It was
a matter of ends and ideals, and these we must now briefly
consider.</p>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Ideals</span></h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Ἐν οὐρανᾥ ἴσως παράδειγμα ἀνάκειται τῷ βουλομένῳ ὁρᾶν,
καὶ ὁρῶντι ἑαυτὸν κατοικίζειν.</p>

<p class="right">Plato, <i>Republic</i> 592 <span class="allsmcap">B</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The rhetorical system of education, much praised and universally
accepted, had many points in its favour. It seemed
to be the only method, backed as it was by a great tradition.
It was regular and well organized and stable by reason of its
imperial support. It had produced many great men in the past
and had the blessing of mighty names. That was enough for
the fourth-century Gaul, who did not trouble to make distinctions.
For the voices of protest had long died down, and
this was the time of ‘Rhetorica triumphans’.</p>

<p>It was also undoubtedly a necessary means of training men for
public speaking, popular because the emperor so substantially
encouraged the imperial orator. The service of the State was
a laudable aspiration. Moreover, the rhetorical exercises produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
ingenuity and nimbleness of wit. They were very laudable, also,
for creating lucidity of thought, by insisting-on clear-cut
arrangement in every theme. The ‘Panegyrici Latini’ are
an example of this. To themselves they could have applied
the saying of Voltaire: ‘nous sommes comme les petits
ruisseaux: sommes clairs parce que nous sommes peu profonds’.<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a>
They have neither the formlessness of the Fathers
nor the complexity of Sidonius. Further, there was a good
side to all the concentration on form that is so prominent in
this period. It kept the language pure at a time when it was
feared that Latin would be utterly barbarized.<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> It preserved
the grammar, and did much to preserve the form. When we
find Rome tenaciously keeping for herself the teaching of law,
and standardizing education by connecting the teachers directly
with the emperor, it is because she realizes that the Latin
language is the medium through which she rules, and that
uniform obedience depends on her subjects uniformly understanding
her commands.</p>

<p>There was also a physical aspect. Proper exercise of the
organs of speech is regarded by medical opinion as comparable
to walking and swimming. In modern times we lay stress on
the exercise of all parts of the body, but tend to neglect the
proper cultivation of elocution. If we developed it more we
might hear less of such prevalent things as ‘minister’s’ and
‘schoolmaster’s’ sore throat. Medical evidence goes to show
that better exercise of the vocal organs is far more effective
than surgical remedies.</p>

<p>More important was the aesthetic side. We to-day have
largely lost the sense of beauty in speech. Language has
become to us for the most part a matter of the written word.
We have ceased to feel as vividly as Isocrates did in his letter
to Philip<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> the need of the living voice to express the soul of
which the letters are the body. The artistic joy which is found
in the form and arrangement of words, in the sound given to
them by a dramatic speaker, in the gestures of an accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
orator—this joy has largely disappeared. Yet we feel that it
was there in the Latin panegyrists. We may say that theirs is
‘a tale of little meaning’, but we must admit that ‘the words
are strong’—strong and beautiful. To read their productions
is like looking on a piece of mediaeval art, a stained-glass window,
where the figures are grotesque and the fable futile, but the
richly blended colours bind us by their beauty. They knew
and lived for the inner loveliness of words. And perhaps they
would say to us: ‘You who read so widely and know so much,
you think you understand. But in order really to understand
you must hear the word pronounced so that its sound as well
as its form calls up a picture to the mind. It is only when
you conceive of the study of a language as artistic both in
sound and in form that it becomes the key to poetry. Do you
not sometimes neglect the sound in your studies?’</p>

<p>They might also have said that there was an inarticulateness
in modern times which led to misunderstanding: that if men
had been taught to express their thoughts better there would
be less strife and less dumb agony. And to a certain extent
they would have been right.</p>

<p>But against them we can urge serious charges. The simplest
and most fundamental objection to the rhetorical system is that
it neglected the search for truth. It thought too much of means
and too little of ends. Lessing stated in his <i>Laocoon</i> the
eternal aim of science. ‘The ultimate object of the sciences is
truth. Truth is necessary to the soul, and in the satisfaction of
this essential need it is tyranny to employ even the slightest
check.’<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> The words apply to the education of our period.
For the teachers of that time did not make truth their chief
end, and how much tyranny there resulted for the soul of man
we have had some opportunity of seeing.</p>

<p>The ancients felt this themselves. They recognized the force
of Seneca’s dictum: ‘Scholae non vitae discimus’. Tacitus had
criticized the system in his <i>Dialogue</i>, and Petronius is very outspoken
in his condemnation. He considers that the school<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
produces in its pupils not wisdom but folly, seeing that what
they hear or see there has no bearing on practical life. ‘It is
for ever pirates standing in chains on the beach, tyrants
writing edicts in which they order sons to cut off their
fathers’ heads, oracles to avert a pestilence demanding the
sacrifice of three or more virgins, verbal honey-balls, all words
and acts sprinkled, as it were, with poppy seed and sesame.
Children brought up in these surroundings can no more be
sensible than those who live in a kitchen can be fragrant.’<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a></p>

<p>The school-exercises which Aphthonius prescribed clearly
illustrate these objections. The artificiality of obeying all the
rules at all times for a certain type of subject is apparent
even in the models. In a little essay on ‘Poverty’, introduced
by two verses of Theognis, the poet, under the heading
ἐγκωμιαστικόν, is praised at length for seeing what an exaggerated
emphasis poets lay on myths, and turning to serious
moral teaching.<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> He is also praised for observing metrical
rules, which is at any rate less harmful than the sentiment
expressed in the text that it is better to die than to be poor.
Under the heading ‘cause’ it is alleged that poverty is incompatible
with virtue. Those who are rid of poverty grow up
fine men and do glorious deeds and entertain the poor. Look
at Irus, the beggar (under the heading παραδείγματα)—he
was so poor that he had even to change his name: for
formerly he was called Arnaeus. And think of all the woes
of Ulysses himself when he came home in the disguise of a
beggar. How terrible it is to be poor! For all this a verse
must be found from some poet (under the heading μαρτυρία
παλαιῶν) in order to give the seal of respectability. This
quotation is generally chosen quite irrespective of the main
theme, Euripides being quoted on this occasion to the effect
that poverty cannot change nobility of birth.</p>

<p>Truth is made to consist in the nature of the charge brought,
and not sought in the human facts of the case. Thus, in the
stock example of a speech against a tyrant,<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> we have a ‘<i>conjectural</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
attack on the man’s past life’, and an ‘exclusion of
pity’ worked up with the utmost artificiality. Ingenuity, not
truth, is the object. And the same can be said of the ‘Encomium’,
in which we find the germ of the panegyric. Of all
these exercises those which fall under the heading of ‘Description’<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a>
are the only ones which possess any kind of naturalness.</p>

<p>The reflection of this unnaturalness is abundantly seen in the
literature of the day. Almost any work of Ausonius could be
taken as an illustration. He consciously opposes grace to
strength, and the result is disappointing. ‘Si qua tibi in his
versiculis videbuntur ... fucatius concinnata quam verius, et
plus coloris quam suci habere, ipse sciens fluere permisi, venustula
ut essent magis quam forticula.’<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> He takes nineteen
lines to express the number six,<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> and fourteen lines to say that
there were thirty oysters.<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> Such a ‘numerum doctis involutum
ambagibus’ seems to have been a common way of expending
‘poetic’ energy. Then, as if this were not enough, he goes on
to expound the ‘doctae ambages’ in the baldest possible way
(<i>Septenis quater adde et unum et unum, etc.</i>) in twelve more lines.
Similar examples could be indefinitely multiplied. Nor were
they just the whim of an idle humour. We meet them everywhere.
Bishop Sidonius at the age of fifty says, in a serious
estimate of a man’s poetic abilities, that he was good at ‘echoing’
and ‘recurrent’ verses, and at ‘anadiplosis’<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> (i.e. resuming a
verse with the end phrase of the previous one). Asked by
a correspondent as to recurrent verses, he gives a stock example
(<i>antiquum</i>), which shows that the literary practice was of some
standing. The point of such a verse was that it could be read
backwards letter for letter without altering the sense:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">while in a ‘versus echoicus’ the first part of the first verse was
the same as the second part of the second. He adds another
kind which he had composed while delayed by a swollen river,
and here the merit was that the words could be read backwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
retaining the order of the letters in each word, without prejudice
to the sense:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Praecipiti modo quod decurrit tramite flumen</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">tempore consumptum iam cito deficiet.<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">His appreciation of Remigius’s declamations show the same emphasis
on formal and external merits.<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> The point is not so much
that responsible poets went in for writing verses of the kind
quoted, but that they attached so much importance to them.</p>

<p>It is striking how many of Ausonius’s poems have to do
with the dead<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> or the unreal.<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> Even his letters are full of
artificialities. In the same way Sidonius and Avitus of Vienne
are always writing epitaphs. Their interest is with the past,
of which they are the conscious imitators;<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> and if Ausonius
was genuinely interested in the living present when he wrote
the <i>Mosella</i>, that is his one poem which has commended itself
to readers of every age. In general, we may say that the
‘litterati’ of this time imitated the past in style and language
to a degree that destroyed individuality. Though Sidonius
criticizes Titianus for copying people not of his age,<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a> his own
writings abound in archaisms.<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> He praises Claudianus Mamertus<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a>
and Leo, the minister of Euric,<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> for their imitation
of antiquity. Claudianus Mamertus recommends as models
of style Naevius, Plautus, Cato, Varro, Gracchus, and ‘Chryssiphus’,
Fronto and Cicero, adding that even the modern
writers of note did not read the moderns: attention must
therefore be concentrated on the ancients, for they are the
source of modern merit.<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> Nor was this merely theoretical
advice. How extensive the worship of the ancients was,
from the scrupulous imitation of Cicero in Eumenius and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
panegyrists<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> to the plagiarism of Vergil by everybody, has
been fully demonstrated by the various editors.<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> All this
meant a turning away from the living language, the creation
of a scholastic tongue, the intellectualization of education.
So, when Greek literature lost its vitality, we find a rigid
and senseless Atticism appearing in Dionysius of Halicarnassus
during the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; the dual was brought up from
the underworld; and language, instead of developing its resources,
was stretched on the Procrustes-bed of a standard that had ceased
to be natural.<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> So, too, when the living genius of Petrarch and
Dante arose, it broke away from the half-dead Latin and turned
to Italian. The problem here involved arises to-day in many
countries. In Holland the growing Flemish Movement headed
by Stijn Streuvels and others has compelled recognition; in
Norway there is a similar movement; and in South Africa the
Education Department is increasingly recognizing the use of
Afrikaans in the schools. For the more education disregards
the form of the language that lives in the hearts of the people,
the less will it understand and be able to teach them effectively.
In other words, an undue archaism means artificiality, means
a wandering from the truth.</p>

<p>The result was (as we may judge from the complaints of the
critics) that the product of the rhetorical system often found
himself in the position of a fire-brigade without a fire. He had
all the machinery, and had used it all in mock alarms, but
had missed that contact with reality which makes for understanding.
He had come to look on facility of speech (to which
the Gauls were particularly prone)<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> as an end in itself. He had
been taught to think that everything was a matter of rule,<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
and often found too late that life demanded a different and
a deeper method.</p>

<p>Why was it that the rhetorical system, with all its virtues,
failed in this way? To put it quite shortly, we should say that
it failed because it did not aim at the best. Ennodius indicates
its aims in two brief sentences. ‘Nos vitae maculas tergimus
artis ope’<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a>—polish, style, external refinement; ‘Qui nostris
servit studiis, mox imperat orbi’—imperial service. These were
the two main objects, both of them good and desirable in themselves,
but not the highest. And it was because the abuse of
these two aims led to a conflict between them and the highest
aim, truth, because the rhetorical system was content with
a second best<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> which could not remain uncorrupted except in
connexion with the best, it was for this reason that, ultimately,
failure inevitably ensued. Other and more material causes may
easily be argued, but this is the inherent and fundamental cause.</p>

<p>How far did the Christian ideal prove a truer inspiration to
education? It has been remarked that paganism had no idea
of progress. The note of pessimism in Roman literature is
typified in such passages as Horace’s:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Aetas parentum peior avis tulit</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">nos nequiores, mox daturos</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">progeniem vitiosiorem.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But with the Gospels, when the watchword of ‘Estote perfecti’
turned men’s backward glances forward to the light, the doctrine
of progress began to establish itself more firmly.<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a></p>

<p>Now progress depends on the truth and the vividness of the
ideal in view, and there can be no doubt that the Christians of
our period felt their ideal as a much more living and constant
inspiration than the pagans felt theirs. Paulinus of Pella
illustrates this. His poem is alive with sincere devotion, and
the usual dryness of the author draws a vigour and an inspiration
from religious emotion which makes the work, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
of its lack of literary formalities, compare favourably with the
Panegyrists or the semi-Christian writers.<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> His ardour and
singleness of purpose<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> are also seen in the <i>De Providentia</i> and the
<i>Ad Uxorem</i>. In spite of all the sufferings of the ten-years’
slaughter (<i>caedes decennis</i>), there is the clear-eyed calmness of one
who sees an ideal whose brightness and steadiness are undimmed
by the storm.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">sincerum vivo de fonte liquorem.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The ideal was deeply felt and widely spread. Even Sidonius
could say of Lupus: ‘tota illi actionum suarum intentio ...
Christus est’.<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> There was a conscious strength in the idealism
of these men which counted for much. ‘The Roman world
crashes into ruin’, wrote Jerome, in another connexion, ‘yet our
heads are upright and unbowed.’<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a></p>

<p>This ideal had its effect on oratory. When Augustine wrote
the Christian theory of eloquence,<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> though he bases the technical
part of it entirely on Cicero and though his sermons abound in
parallelism, homoioteleuta, and even word-play, yet he made
a great advance in declaring that eloquence was not dependent
on rhetorical rules but based, rather, on genuine knowledge and
true wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a> He felt keenly the lack of truth in the rhetorical
system. Of its teachers he says that truth was found constantly
on their lips but never in their lives: ‘Dicebant Veritas et
Veritas, et multum eam dicebant mihi, et nusquam erat in eis,
et falsa loquebantur.’<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> And he laid down his professorship of
rhetoric so that he should not be guilty of selling material
for the madness of the youths who studied the foolish falsehoods
and practised the quibbling disputations of the rhetorical
system.<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> In the <i>Principia Rhetorices</i> he lays stress on understanding
the case,<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> and maintains that the end of oratory is not
merely ‘bene aut vere dicere’ (as the later rhetoricians certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
thought), but ‘persuadere’.<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> Thus he brings out the Christian
conception of the essential relation of oratory to man—an ideal
which Isocrates and Cicero had preached, but which had gradually
been lost.</p>

<p>Similarly, in his theory of Christian education, the influence
of the ideal is seen. In his scheme of learning, philosophy
must make us understand ‘the order of things’, and help us
to distinguish two worlds and Him who is the Father of
the Universe.<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> The whole perspective is determined by the
Divine. Everything is related to it. And it is not a mere
philosophical abstraction but a real and life-giving centre.</p>

<p>Jung, having described the barrenness of pagan studies, says:
‘Studia eadem in scholis clericorum’,<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> and proves from Isidore
and Gregory that the old Roman scheme of education was
accepted throughout by the Christians. But there is something
more to be said. The Christian schools, in so far as they did
not fall into utter formlessness, accepted the scheme of Martianus
Capella and of pagan education. But, in many cases at any
rate, there was a change for the better in method and spirit.
The Christians used their rhetoric in a living cause, their
dialectic to probe questions crowded with contemporary interest;
their Livy and Sallust to develop a philosophy of history, their
literature to understand and spread the cause of truth for which
they had been martyred. The pagans, on the other hand, used
their rhetoric for fictitious cases (<i>falsas lites</i>), their dialectic for
ingenious trifling, their history as the handmaid of rhetoric, their
literature to imitate Cicero or Fronto or Pliny, to write freakish
verses, or to flatter the emperor. A sign of the advance made
by the Christians in the search for truth is that criticism begins
to awake in a world on which traditional ideas had lain</p>

<p>Vigilantius in Gaul criticizes the rites of the Church and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Pelagianism, Priscillianism, the questions about the spirituality
of the soul—all point to a new stimulation of the intellect.</p>

<p>Yet Christian education also failed in its search for truth.
As we have seen, the exigencies of the time drove its exponents
to a zealous narrowness whose watchword was stated by Claudianus
Mamertus, when, in his <i>Contra vanos poetas</i>, he said that
the divine <i>alone</i> must be studied:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Incipe divinis tantum dare pectora rebus.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">By limiting the meaning of ‘divina’ to dogma, the Church
imposed fetters on the seeker after truth which, though not
very prominent in our period, became exceedingly galling in
the times that followed. Eucherius (to take a final example)
writes to Valerian appealing to him to lay aside the love of the
world and the study of worldly philosophy, to turn to the study
of true piety and true philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> The key-note of the letter
is: ‘Quid enim prodest homini si mundum universum lucretur,
animae vero suae detrimentum patiatur?’ with a special connotation
of ‘mundum’. The incompatibility between secular
and sacred literature is emphasized, and illustrated by edifying
stories about Clement, Gregory, and Paulinus of Nola. The
conclusion is: ‘Quin tu, repudiatis illis philosophorum praeceptis
... ad imbibenda Christiana dogmatis studia animum
adicis?... In illis namque eorum praeceptis vel adumbrata
virtus vel falsa sapientia....’ The position is not that the
philosophers should be read and then rejected, but that they
should not be read at all.</p>

<p>Thus, the leaders of Christian education in Gaul, however
excusable their attitude at the time, established that regrettable
dichotomy between secular and sacred knowledge which has been
the bane of succeeding ages. While, on the one hand, they
made an advance towards truth by stimulating thought and
criticism, on the other, they did not, perhaps could not, succeed
in recognizing that truth is one and indivisible, and that her
seekers know of no such divisions.</p>

<p>And so we are forced back on our ever-recurring problem:
how is man, his emotions and environment being what they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
are, to attain to the scientific attitude of mind? Socrates long
ago saw the difficulty of having a body which fills us with
‘passions and desires and fears and all sorts of fancies and
foolishness’, and makes it impossible for us to be single-minded
in our pursuit of the truth.<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> Yet he, and the great teachers
of mankind throughout the ages, have insisted with an earnestness
that reached to martyrdom, that such an unswerving and
disinterested quest is the one result in education that truly
matters, that it is the condition of progress and the criterion of
culture. And if the way is long and the battle fierce, we must
choose the dust and heat rather than lose sight of the ideal.

<p><a id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">[72]</a> That the Gallic Mercury resembled his Roman namesake in this
respect is proved by the fact that one of the names of the Celtic Mercury
was Visucius, which comes from the root VID = know (Robert and
Cagnat, <i>Épigraphie de la Moselle</i>, p. 59). And Caesar noted as one of the
characteristics of the Gallic Mercury that he was ‘omnium inventorem
artium’ (<i>Bell. Gall.</i> vi. 17), though in later times he comes to be connected
chiefly with commerce (cf. Caesar, <i>l.c.</i>). See Daremberg-Saglio.</p>

Gothic king (<i>Ep.</i> viii. 3). Thus the star of rhetoricians and grammarians
rose high at the court of Theodoric.</p>

somewhat unfair (<i>La fin du paganisme</i>, i. 219 ff.). He says Quintilian
regarded the grammarian as an intruder, but Quintilian is merely protesting
against the assumption of the rhetor’s duties by the grammarian
(ii. 1. 2-6) and is quite willing to give him his due (ii. 1. 13). However,
he does seem to attach an exaggerated importance to rhetoric
(e.g. ii. 20) as opposed to general knowledge.</p>

once mentioned. Symmachus and Capella, both representative of
culture in their day, are silent about Christianity. There was always
the suspicion, even between two contending Christians, that the other
might not have had the rhetorical or philosophical training necessary
for argument. Cf. Jerome to Vigilantius: ‘Scilicet et gloriari cupis ...
me non potuisse respondere eloquentiae tuae et acumen in te Chrysippi

(cf. Pliny, <i>N. H.</i> xxxiv. 57 ‘Myronem ... bucula maxime nobilitavit

little more than that of the thirty-six epigrams on Myron’s heifer preserved
in the Greek Anthology. That the appreciation of an epigram,
however, need not necessarily be artificial is proved, e.g. by iv. 54 of the

complains that Carthage is much worse than Rome. The tradition of

Hodgkin remarks (I. i. 2, pp. 920 ff.), he was a truthful man, and had an
enthusiasm for justice, and as such he saw that there was much to be
said on the anti-Roman side. Cf. ‘... inciperent esse quasi barbari, quia

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
